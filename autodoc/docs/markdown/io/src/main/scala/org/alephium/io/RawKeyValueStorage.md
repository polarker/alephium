The code provided is a trait called `RawKeyValueStorage` that defines a set of methods for interacting with a key-value storage system. The purpose of this trait is to provide a common interface for different implementations of key-value storage, allowing for easy swapping of storage systems without changing the code that uses it.

The methods defined in this trait include `getRawUnsafe`, `getOptRawUnsafe`, `putRawUnsafe`, `putBatchRawUnsafe`, `existsRawUnsafe`, and `deleteRawUnsafe`. These methods are used to retrieve, store, and delete key-value pairs in the storage system.

The `getRawUnsafe` method takes a `ByteString` key as input and returns the corresponding `ByteString` value. If the key does not exist in the storage system, an exception is thrown. The `getOptRawUnsafe` method is similar to `getRawUnsafe`, but returns an `Option[ByteString]` instead of throwing an exception if the key does not exist.

The `putRawUnsafe` method takes a `ByteString` key and value as input and stores them in the storage system. The `putBatchRawUnsafe` method is used for batch operations, taking a function that accepts a key-value pair and stores it in the storage system. This method is useful for improving performance when storing multiple key-value pairs at once.

The `existsRawUnsafe` method checks if a key exists in the storage system and returns a boolean value. The `deleteRawUnsafe` method removes a key-value pair from the storage system.

Overall, this trait provides a flexible and extensible way to interact with key-value storage systems in the Alephium project. Different implementations of this trait can be used depending on the specific storage system being used, allowing for easy swapping and customization. Here is an example of how this trait can be used:

```scala
import org.alephium.io.RawKeyValueStorage
import akka.util.ByteString

class MyStorage extends RawKeyValueStorage {
  // implementation of methods here
}

val storage = new MyStorage()
val key = ByteString("myKey")
val value = ByteString("myValue")

storage.putRawUnsafe(key, value)
val retrievedValue = storage.getRawUnsafe(key)
println(retrievedValue.utf8String) // prints "myValue"

storage.deleteRawUnsafe(key)
val exists = storage.existsRawUnsafe(key)
println(exists) // prints "false"
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `RawKeyValueStorage` trait?
   - The `RawKeyValueStorage` trait defines a set of methods for interacting with a key-value storage system, allowing for getting, putting, and deleting raw byte strings associated with specific keys.

2. What is the significance of the `ByteString` type?
   - The `ByteString` type is used as the key and value type for the methods in the `RawKeyValueStorage` trait, indicating that the key-value storage system is designed to work with raw byte strings.

3. What licensing terms apply to this code?
   - This code is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3 or later, which allows for the free distribution and modification of the code, but with certain restrictions and requirements for attribution and sharing of modifications.
