This file contains a set of sealed traits and case classes that define a cache system for the Alephium project. The cache system is designed to store and manage data in memory, allowing for faster access and retrieval of frequently used data. 

The `Cache` trait is the base trait for all cache objects and is sealed, meaning that all implementations of the trait must be defined in the same file. The `ValueExists` trait is used to indicate that a value exists in the cache and provides a method to retrieve the value. The `KeyExistedInUnderlying` trait is used to indicate that a key exists in the underlying data store, but may not be present in the cache. 

The `Cached` case class extends the `Cache` trait and implements the `KeyExistedInUnderlying` and `ValueExists` traits. This case class is used to represent a value that is currently stored in the cache. 

The `Modified` trait extends the `Cache` trait and is used to represent a change to the cache. The `Inserted` case class extends the `Modified` trait and implements the `ValueExists` trait. This case class is used to represent a new value that has been inserted into the cache. The `Removed` case class extends the `Modified` trait and implements the `KeyExistedInUnderlying` trait. This case class is used to represent a value that has been removed from the cache. The `Updated` case class extends the `Modified` trait and implements both the `KeyExistedInUnderlying` and `ValueExists` traits. This case class is used to represent a value that has been updated in the cache. 

Overall, this cache system provides a way to efficiently store and manage data in memory for faster access and retrieval. It can be used in various parts of the Alephium project where caching is necessary, such as in the storage and retrieval of transaction data or block data. 

Example usage:

```scala
val cache: Cache[String] = Cached("hello world")
val modifiedCache: Modified[String] = Updated("new value")
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Cache` trait and its subtypes?
- The `Cache` trait and its subtypes (`Cached`, `Modified`, `Inserted`, `Removed`, and `Updated`) are used to represent different states of a cache, where `Cached` represents a value that exists in the cache, `Inserted` represents a new value that was added to the cache, `Removed` represents a value that was removed from the cache, and `Updated` represents a value that was updated in the cache.

2. What is the `ValueExists` trait used for?
- The `ValueExists` trait is used to define a type that has a value of type `V`, which is used in the `Cached`, `Inserted`, and `Updated` subtypes of `Cache`.

3. What is the purpose of the `KeyExistedInUnderlying` trait?
- The `KeyExistedInUnderlying` trait is used to indicate that a key existed in the underlying data structure of the cache, which is used in the `Cached`, `Removed`, and `Updated` subtypes of `Cache`.
