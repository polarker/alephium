This file contains a trait called `RocksDBKeyValueCompanion` which defines a set of methods for creating instances of a `RocksDBKeyValueStorage` implementation. The purpose of this trait is to provide a standardized way of creating instances of `RocksDBKeyValueStorage` that use the same set of default options for read and write operations.

The `RocksDBKeyValueCompanion` trait defines three `apply` methods that can be used to create instances of `RocksDBKeyValueStorage`. The first method takes a `RocksDBSource` object and a `ColumnFamily` object as arguments, and returns an instance of `S` (where `S` is a type that extends `RocksDBKeyValueStorage`). This method uses the default `WriteOptions` and `ReadOptions` defined in the `Settings` object.

The second method takes the same arguments as the first method, but also takes a `WriteOptions` object as an additional argument. This method allows the caller to specify custom write options for the `RocksDBKeyValueStorage` instance.

The third method takes all three arguments (`RocksDBSource`, `ColumnFamily`, `WriteOptions`) as well as a `ReadOptions` object. This method allows the caller to specify custom read options for the `RocksDBKeyValueStorage` instance.

Overall, this trait provides a convenient way to create instances of `RocksDBKeyValueStorage` with consistent default options. This can be useful in a larger project where multiple instances of `RocksDBKeyValueStorage` are used, as it ensures that all instances are created with the same set of options. Here is an example of how this trait might be used:

```scala
import org.alephium.io.{RocksDBKeyValueCompanion, RocksDBKeyValueStorage, RocksDBSource}
import org.rocksdb.{ReadOptions, WriteOptions}

class MyKeyValueStorage extends RocksDBKeyValueStorage[String, Int] {
  // implementation details
}

object MyKeyValueStorage extends RocksDBKeyValueCompanion[MyKeyValueStorage] {
  def apply(
      storage: RocksDBSource,
      cf: RocksDBSource.ColumnFamily,
      writeOptions: WriteOptions,
      readOptions: ReadOptions
  ): MyKeyValueStorage = {
    // custom implementation details
    new MyKeyValueStorage()
  }
}

val storage = MyKeyValueStorage(RocksDBSource.default, RocksDBSource.defaultColumnFamily)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code defines a trait `RocksDBKeyValueCompanion` that provides methods to create instances of a `RocksDBKeyValueStorage` implementation using different options.
2. What is the `RocksDBKeyValueStorage` interface?
   - The `RocksDBKeyValueStorage` interface is not defined in this code, but it is likely a key-value storage interface that is implemented using RocksDB as the underlying storage engine.
3. What is the `RocksDBSource` class?
   - The `RocksDBSource` class is not defined in this code, but it is likely a class that provides access to a RocksDB database instance and its column families.
