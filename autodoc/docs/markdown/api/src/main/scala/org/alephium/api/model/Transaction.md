The `Transaction` class is a model for a transaction in the Alephium blockchain. It contains information about the unsigned transaction, whether the script execution was successful, the contract inputs, the generated outputs, the input signatures, and the script signatures. 

The `toProtocol` method converts the `Transaction` object to a `protocol.Transaction` object, which is used in the Alephium blockchain protocol. This method first converts the `unsigned` field to a `protocol.UnsignedTx` object using the `toProtocol` method of the `UnsignedTx` class. It then deserializes the `inputSignatures` and `scriptSignatures` fields using the `deserialize` method from the `serde` package. Finally, it constructs a `protocol.Transaction` object using the converted fields and returns it.

The `fromProtocol` method is a companion object method that converts a `protocol.Transaction` object to a `Transaction` object. This method first converts the `unsigned` field of the `protocol.Transaction` object to an `UnsignedTx` object using the `fromProtocol` method of the `UnsignedTx` class. It then converts the `contractInputs` field to an `AVector[OutputRef]` object using the `OutputRef.from` method. The `generatedOutputs` field is converted to an `AVector[Output]` object using the `Output.from` method, which takes the `unsigned.id` and the index of the output as arguments. Finally, it serializes the `inputSignatures` and `scriptSignatures` fields using the `serialize` method from the `serde` package and constructs a `Transaction` object using the converted fields and returns it.

This class is used in the Alephium blockchain to represent transactions and to convert them to and from the protocol format. It is an important part of the Alephium API and is used extensively in the Alephium client software. Here is an example of how to use the `Transaction` class:

```scala
import org.alephium.api.model.Transaction

// create a new transaction
val tx = Transaction(
  unsigned = ..., // create an UnsignedTx object
  scriptExecutionOk = true,
  contractInputs = ..., // create an AVector[OutputRef] object
  generatedOutputs = ..., // create an AVector[Output] object
  inputSignatures = ..., // create an AVector[ByteString] object
  scriptSignatures = ... // create an AVector[ByteString] object
)

// convert the transaction to a protocol transaction
val protocolTx = tx.toProtocol()

// convert a protocol transaction to a transaction
val tx2 = Transaction.fromProtocol(protocolTx)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Transaction` class?
   - The `Transaction` class represents a transaction in the Alephium protocol, containing information such as unsigned transaction data, input and script signatures, and generated outputs.
2. What is the `toProtocol` method used for?
   - The `toProtocol` method is used to convert a `Transaction` object to a `protocol.Transaction` object, which is a serialized version of the transaction that can be broadcasted to the Alephium network.
3. What is the `fromProtocol` method used for?
   - The `fromProtocol` method is used to convert a `protocol.Transaction` object to a `Transaction` object, which can be used to interact with the transaction data in a more convenient way within the Alephium codebase.
