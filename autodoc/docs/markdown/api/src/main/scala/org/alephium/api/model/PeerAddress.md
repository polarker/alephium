The code defines a case class called `PeerAddress` which represents the address of a peer in the Alephium network. The `PeerAddress` class has four fields: `address`, `restPort`, `wsPort`, and `minerApiPort`. 

The `address` field is of type `InetAddress` and represents the IP address of the peer. The `restPort` field is an integer that represents the port number for the REST API of the peer. The `wsPort` field is an integer that represents the port number for the WebSocket API of the peer. The `minerApiPort` field is an integer that represents the port number for the miner API of the peer.

This class is likely used in other parts of the Alephium project where peer addresses need to be stored or passed around. For example, it could be used in the implementation of the peer-to-peer networking layer to keep track of the addresses of other nodes in the network. It could also be used in the implementation of the mining algorithm to connect to other nodes and retrieve mining work.

Here is an example of how the `PeerAddress` class could be used:

```scala
import org.alephium.api.model.PeerAddress
import java.net.InetAddress

val peerAddress = PeerAddress(InetAddress.getByName("127.0.0.1"), 8080, 8081, 8082)
println(peerAddress.address.getHostAddress) // prints "127.0.0.1"
println(peerAddress.restPort) // prints 8080
println(peerAddress.wsPort) // prints 8081
println(peerAddress.minerApiPort) // prints 8082
```

In this example, a new `PeerAddress` object is created with the IP address "127.0.0.1" and port numbers 8080, 8081, and 8082 for the REST API, WebSocket API, and miner API respectively. The `getHostAddress` method is called on the `address` field to retrieve the IP address as a string, and the other fields are accessed directly to retrieve their values.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `PeerAddress` case class?
   - The `PeerAddress` case class represents the address of a peer in the Alephium network, including its IP address and various port numbers.

2. What is the significance of the GNU Lesser General Public License mentioned in the code comments?
   - The GNU Lesser General Public License is the license under which the Alephium library is distributed, allowing users to redistribute and modify the library under certain conditions.

3. What other packages or files might be related to this `PeerAddress` class in the `alephium` project?
   - It is unclear from this code snippet alone, but other packages or files related to networking or peer-to-peer communication in the Alephium project may be related to the `PeerAddress` class.
