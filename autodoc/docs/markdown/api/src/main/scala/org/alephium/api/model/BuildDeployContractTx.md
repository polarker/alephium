The `BuildDeployContractTx` class is a model that represents a transaction for deploying a smart contract on the Alephium blockchain. It contains various parameters required for the deployment of the contract, such as the public key of the sender, the bytecode of the contract, the initial amount of Aleph tokens to be sent to the contract, the initial amounts of other tokens to be sent to the contract, the amount of gas to be used for the transaction, the gas price, and the target block hash.

The `BuildDeployContractTx` class extends the `BuildTxCommon` trait, which provides common functionality for building transactions. It also extends the `BuildTxCommon.FromPublicKey` trait, which specifies that the transaction must have a `fromPublicKey` field.

The `BuildDeployContractTx` class has a `decodeBytecode` method that deserializes the bytecode of the contract into a `BuildDeployContractTx.Code` object. The `BuildDeployContractTx.Code` class represents the deserialized bytecode and contains the contract object, the initial immutable fields, and the initial mutable fields. The `BuildDeployContractTx.Code` class also has a `serde` object that provides serialization and deserialization functionality for the class.

The `BuildDeployContractTx` class is used in the larger Alephium project to deploy smart contracts on the blockchain. Developers can create instances of the `BuildDeployContractTx` class with the required parameters and then submit them to the Alephium network to deploy their contracts. The `decodeBytecode` method can be used to deserialize the bytecode of the contract and obtain the contract object, which can then be used to interact with the deployed contract.

Example usage:

```scala
import akka.util.ByteString
import org.alephium.api.model.{BuildDeployContractTx, Token}
import org.alephium.protocol.model.BlockHash
import org.alephium.protocol.vm.{GasBox, GasPrice, StatefulContract}
import org.alephium.serde._
import org.alephium.util.AVector

// Create a contract object
val contract = StatefulContract(...) // create a StatefulContract object

// Create an initial immutable field
val immField = vm.Val(...) // create a vm.Val object

// Create an initial mutable field
val mutField = vm.Val(...) // create a vm.Val object

// Create a vector of initial immutable fields
val immFields = AVector(immField)

// Create a vector of initial mutable fields
val mutFields = AVector(mutField)

// Serialize the contract object, initial immutable fields, and initial mutable fields
val codeBytes = serialize(BuildDeployContractTx.Code(contract, immFields, mutFields))

// Create a BuildDeployContractTx object
val tx = BuildDeployContractTx(
  fromPublicKey = ByteString(...), // set the public key of the sender
  bytecode = codeBytes, // set the serialized bytecode of the contract
  initialAttoAlphAmount = Some(Amount(...)), // set the initial amount of Aleph tokens to be sent to the contract
  initialTokenAmounts = Some(AVector(Token(...))), // set the initial amounts of other tokens to be sent to the contract
  issueTokenAmount = Some(Amount(...)), // set the amount of tokens to be issued by the contract
  gasAmount = Some(GasBox(...)), // set the amount of gas to be used for the transaction
  gasPrice = Some(GasPrice(...)), // set the gas price
  targetBlockHash = Some(BlockHash(...)) // set the target block hash
)

// Deserialize the bytecode of the contract
val code = tx.decodeBytecode().getOrElse(throw new Exception("Failed to decode bytecode"))

// Get the contract object
val contractObj = code.contract

// Interact with the deployed contract using the contract object
contractObj.method(...)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `BuildDeployContractTx` class?
   - The `BuildDeployContractTx` class is used to build a transaction for deploying a stateful contract on the Alephium blockchain, with various optional parameters such as initial token amounts and gas settings.

2. What is the `Code` case class and how is it used?
   - The `Code` case class represents the bytecode of a deployed contract, along with its initial immutable and mutable fields. It is used to decode the bytecode from a `BuildDeployContractTx` instance into a `Code` instance using the `decodeBytecode()` method.

3. What is the purpose of the `serde` field in the `Code` object?
   - The `serde` field is a `Serde` instance that is used to serialize and deserialize instances of the `Code` case class. It also includes a validation function that checks whether the length of the initial immutable and mutable fields matches the expected length for the contract.
