The code defines a Scala case class called `SelfClique` that represents a clique of peers in the Alephium network. A clique is a group of nodes that are connected to each other and share information about the state of the network. The `SelfClique` class has four fields: `cliqueId`, which is a unique identifier for the clique; `nodes`, which is a vector of `PeerAddress` objects representing the nodes in the clique; `selfReady`, which is a boolean indicating whether the local node is ready to participate in the clique; and `synced`, which is a boolean indicating whether the local node is in sync with the rest of the clique.

The `SelfClique` class also has two methods. The first method, `brokerNum`, returns the number of nodes in the clique. The second method, `peer`, takes a `GroupIndex` object as input and returns the `PeerAddress` object corresponding to the node at the specified index in the clique. The index is calculated as the remainder of the group index value divided by the number of nodes in the clique, which ensures that the index is always within the bounds of the `nodes` vector.

This code is part of the Alephium API model, which provides a set of classes and methods for interacting with the Alephium network. The `SelfClique` class is used to represent the local node's view of the clique it belongs to, and the `peer` method can be used to retrieve the `PeerAddress` object for a specific node in the clique. This information can be used, for example, to establish connections between nodes or to query the state of the network.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SelfClique` case class?
   - The `SelfClique` case class is used to represent a clique of peers, including the clique ID, a vector of peer addresses, and information about whether the local node is ready and synced.

2. What is the `brokerNum` method used for?
   - The `brokerNum` method returns the number of nodes in the clique, which is the length of the `nodes` vector.

3. What is the `peer` method used for?
   - The `peer` method returns the peer address at a given `GroupIndex` within the clique, using modular arithmetic to wrap around if the index is greater than the number of nodes in the clique.
