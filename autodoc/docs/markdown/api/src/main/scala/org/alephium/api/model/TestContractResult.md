The code above defines two case classes: `TestContractResult` and `DebugMessage`. These classes are used to represent the result of testing a smart contract and debug messages respectively. 

The `TestContractResult` case class has several fields that represent the result of testing a smart contract. The `address` field is the address of the smart contract being tested. The `codeHash` field is the hash of the smart contract's code. The `returns` field is a vector of `Val` objects that represent the values returned by the smart contract. The `gasUsed` field is an integer that represents the amount of gas used during the execution of the smart contract. The `contracts` field is a vector of `ContractState` objects that represent the state of any contracts created during the execution of the smart contract. The `txInputs` field is a vector of `Address` objects that represent the inputs to the transaction that executed the smart contract. The `txOutputs` field is a vector of `Output` objects that represent the outputs of the transaction that executed the smart contract. The `events` field is a vector of `ContractEventByTxId` objects that represent the events emitted by the smart contract. Finally, the `debugMessages` field is a vector of `DebugMessage` objects that represent any debug messages generated during the execution of the smart contract.

The `DebugMessage` case class has two fields: `contractAddress` and `message`. The `contractAddress` field is the address of the smart contract that generated the debug message. The `message` field is the debug message itself. The `toString` method is overridden to provide a string representation of the debug message that includes the contract address and the message itself.

These case classes are used throughout the Alephium project to represent the results of testing smart contracts and to provide debug information. For example, the `TestContractResult` class is used in the `TestContractResponse` class, which is returned by the `testContract` method of the `ContractApi` class. The `DebugMessage` class is used in the `DebugApi` class to provide debug information to the user.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `TestContractResult` case class?
   - The `TestContractResult` case class is used to represent the result of executing a test contract, including its address, code hash, return values, gas used, and other information.

2. What is the `DebugMessage` case class used for?
   - The `DebugMessage` case class is used to represent a debug message associated with a contract, including its address and message content. It also overrides the `toString()` method to provide a formatted string representation.

3. What are the dependencies of this file?
   - This file depends on several other classes and packages, including `Hash` and `Address` from the `org.alephium.protocol` package, `AVector` from the `org.alephium.util` package, and `Output` and `ContractEventByTxId` from other unspecified packages.
