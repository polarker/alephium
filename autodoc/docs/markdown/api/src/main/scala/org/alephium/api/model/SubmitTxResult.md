This file contains a Scala case class called `SubmitTxResult` that is part of the `org.alephium.api.model` package. The purpose of this class is to represent the result of submitting a transaction to the Alephium blockchain network. 

The `SubmitTxResult` class has three fields: `txId`, `fromGroup`, and `toGroup`. `txId` is of type `TransactionId`, which is a type alias for a byte array representing the ID of the submitted transaction. `fromGroup` and `toGroup` are both of type `Int` and represent the source and destination groups of the transaction, respectively. 

This class is likely used in the larger Alephium project to provide a standardized way of returning the result of a transaction submission to clients of the Alephium API. For example, a client that submits a transaction to the network via the API might receive a `SubmitTxResult` object as a response, which would contain the ID of the submitted transaction as well as information about the source and destination groups. 

Here is an example of how this class might be used in a hypothetical API endpoint that submits a transaction to the network:

```scala
import org.alephium.api.model.SubmitTxResult
import org.alephium.protocol.model.TransactionId

def submitTransaction(txData: Array[Byte]): SubmitTxResult = {
  // code to submit transaction to Alephium network
  val txId: TransactionId = // get ID of submitted transaction
  val fromGroup: Int = // get source group of transaction
  val toGroup: Int = // get destination group of transaction
  SubmitTxResult(txId, fromGroup, toGroup)
}
```

In this example, the `submitTransaction` function takes in the raw transaction data as a byte array and submits it to the Alephium network. It then retrieves the ID of the submitted transaction as well as the source and destination groups, and returns a `SubmitTxResult` object containing this information. The client that called this function would then be able to use the information in the `SubmitTxResult` object to track the status of their submitted transaction.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SubmitTxResult` case class?
   - The `SubmitTxResult` case class is used to represent the result of submitting a transaction, including the transaction ID and the source and destination groups.

2. What is the significance of the `TransactionId` import statement?
   - The `TransactionId` import statement indicates that the `TransactionId` type is used in the `SubmitTxResult` case class.

3. What is the `alephium` project licensed under?
   - The `alephium` project is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License, as stated in the code comments.
