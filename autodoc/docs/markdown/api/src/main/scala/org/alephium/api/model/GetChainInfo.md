The code above defines a case class called `GetChainInfo` which takes two integer parameters `fromGroup` and `toGroup`. This case class is located in the `org.alephium.api.model` package.

The purpose of this case class is to represent a request for information about a chain of blocks in the Alephium blockchain network. The `fromGroup` parameter represents the starting group of blocks in the chain, while the `toGroup` parameter represents the ending group of blocks in the chain.

This case class can be used in conjunction with other classes and methods in the Alephium project to retrieve information about a specific chain of blocks in the network. For example, a method in the project may take a `GetChainInfo` object as a parameter and return information about the blocks in the specified chain.

Here is an example of how this case class may be used in the larger project:

```
import org.alephium.api.model.GetChainInfo

val chainInfo = GetChainInfo(0, 10)
val chainData = getChainData(chainInfo)
```

In the example above, a `GetChainInfo` object is created with a starting group of 0 and an ending group of 10. This object is then passed as a parameter to a hypothetical `getChainData` method which retrieves information about the blocks in the specified chain. The returned `chainData` object would contain information such as the block height, timestamp, and transactions in each block of the specified chain.

Overall, the `GetChainInfo` case class is a small but important component of the Alephium blockchain network, allowing developers to retrieve specific information about chains of blocks in the network.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `GetChainInfo` case class?
   - The `GetChainInfo` case class is used to represent a request for information about a chain between two groups in the Alephium project.

2. What is the significance of the `final` keyword before the `case class` declaration?
   - The `final` keyword indicates that the `GetChainInfo` case class cannot be extended or subclassed by other classes.

3. What is the expected input type for the `fromGroup` and `toGroup` parameters in the `GetChainInfo` case class?
   - The `fromGroup` and `toGroup` parameters in the `GetChainInfo` case class are expected to be of type `Int`.
