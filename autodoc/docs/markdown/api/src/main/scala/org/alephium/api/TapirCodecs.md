The code provided is a Scala file that defines a set of Tapir codecs for the Alephium API. Tapir is a library for building HTTP API endpoints in a type-safe manner. The purpose of this file is to define how the different data types used in the Alephium API should be encoded and decoded when communicating with the API.

The file defines a trait called `TapirCodecs` that extends another trait called `ApiModelCodec`. The `ApiModelCodec` trait defines a set of codecs for the Alephium API data model, while the `TapirCodecs` trait defines additional codecs that are used by the Tapir library.

The file defines codecs for several data types used in the Alephium API, including timestamps, hashes, addresses, public keys, gas boxes, and more. Each codec is defined using the `Codec` class from the Tapir library. The `Codec` class defines how to encode and decode a value of a certain type to and from a string representation. For example, the `timestampTapirCodec` codec defines how to encode and decode a `TimeStamp` object to and from a string representation.

The file also defines a set of implicit conversions that allow the Tapir codecs to be used in other parts of the Alephium API. For example, the `groupIndexCodec` function defines a codec for `GroupIndex` objects that depends on a `GroupConfig` object. This codec can be used to encode and decode `GroupIndex` objects in other parts of the Alephium API.

Overall, this file is an important part of the Alephium API that defines how different data types should be encoded and decoded when communicating with the API. By defining these codecs in a type-safe manner, the Tapir library ensures that the API is robust and free of errors.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file contains Tapir codecs for various data types used in the Alephium API.

2. What licensing terms apply to this code?
- This code is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3 or later.

3. What is the purpose of the `fromJson` method defined in this file?
- The `fromJson` method is a generic method that creates a Tapir codec for a given data type by deserializing JSON strings into instances of that type and vice versa.
