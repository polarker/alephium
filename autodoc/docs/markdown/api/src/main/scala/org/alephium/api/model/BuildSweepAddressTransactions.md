The `BuildSweepAddressTransactions` class is a model used in the Alephium project to build transactions that sweep all assets from a given address to another address. 

The class takes in several parameters, including the public key of the address to sweep from (`fromPublicKey`), the address to sweep to (`toAddress`), and optional parameters such as `lockTime`, `gasAmount`, `gasPrice`, and `targetBlockHash`. 

The `lockTime` parameter specifies the time at which the transaction should be locked and can no longer be modified. The `gasAmount` parameter specifies the amount of gas to be used in the transaction, while the `gasPrice` parameter specifies the price of gas. The `targetBlockHash` parameter specifies the hash of the block to which the transaction should be added. 

The `BuildSweepAddressTransactions` class extends the `BuildTxCommon` trait, which provides common functionality for building transactions. 

This class can be used in the larger Alephium project to facilitate the transfer of assets between addresses. For example, a user may want to sweep all assets from an old address to a new address. They can use this class to build a transaction that accomplishes this task. 

Example usage:

```
val fromPublicKey = PublicKey("...")
val toAddress = Address.Asset("...")
val lockTime = Some(TimeStamp.now())
val gasAmount = Some(GasBox(100))
val gasPrice = Some(GasPrice(10))
val targetBlockHash = Some(BlockHash("..."))

val sweepTx = BuildSweepAddressTransactions(
  fromPublicKey,
  toAddress,
  lockTime,
  gasAmount,
  gasPrice,
  targetBlockHash
)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `BuildSweepAddressTransactions` case class?
- The `BuildSweepAddressTransactions` case class is used to build transactions that sweep all assets from a given address to another address.

2. What are the parameters of the `BuildSweepAddressTransactions` case class?
- The parameters of the `BuildSweepAddressTransactions` case class are `fromPublicKey` (the public key of the address to sweep from), `toAddress` (the address to sweep to), `lockTime` (an optional timestamp to lock the transaction until), `gasAmount` (an optional gas box to pay for the transaction), `gasPrice` (an optional gas price to pay for the transaction), and `targetBlockHash` (an optional block hash to target for the transaction).

3. What are the imported packages used in this file?
- The imported packages used in this file are `org.alephium.protocol.PublicKey`, `org.alephium.protocol.model.{Address, BlockHash}`, `org.alephium.protocol.vm.{GasBox, GasPrice}`, and `org.alephium.util.TimeStamp`.
