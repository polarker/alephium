The `UnsignedTx` class and its companion object in the `org.alephium.api.model` package provide functionality for creating and converting unsigned transactions. 

An unsigned transaction is a transaction that has not been signed by the sender's private key. It contains all the necessary information for a transaction to be executed, except for the signature. Unsigned transactions are used to prevent double-spending and to ensure that the transaction is valid before it is signed.

The `UnsignedTx` class has the following properties:
- `txId`: the ID of the transaction
- `version`: the version of the transaction
- `networkId`: the ID of the network on which the transaction is being executed
- `scriptOpt`: an optional script that specifies the conditions under which the transaction can be executed
- `gasAmount`: the amount of gas required to execute the transaction
- `gasPrice`: the price of gas in the transaction
- `inputs`: a vector of asset inputs to the transaction
- `fixedOutputs`: a vector of fixed asset outputs from the transaction

The `toProtocol` method of the `UnsignedTx` class converts an `UnsignedTx` object to an `UnsignedTransaction` object from the `org.alephium.protocol.model` package. The `UnsignedTransaction` object contains the same information as the `UnsignedTx` object, but is used in the protocol layer of the Alephium blockchain. The `toProtocol` method takes an implicit `NetworkConfig` object as a parameter, which specifies the configuration of the network on which the transaction is being executed. If the conversion is successful, the method returns an `Either` object containing the `UnsignedTransaction` object. If the conversion fails, the method returns an `Either` object containing an error message.

The `fromProtocol` method of the `UnsignedTx` companion object converts an `UnsignedTransaction` object to an `UnsignedTx` object. The method takes an `UnsignedTransaction` object as a parameter and returns an `UnsignedTx` object. The `fromProtocol` method is used to convert `UnsignedTransaction` objects received from the protocol layer to `UnsignedTx` objects used in the API layer.

Overall, the `UnsignedTx` class and its companion object provide a way to create and convert unsigned transactions in the Alephium blockchain. These objects are used in the API layer to interact with the blockchain. For example, an API endpoint that creates a transaction would use an `UnsignedTx` object to create the transaction, and an API endpoint that retrieves a transaction would use the `fromProtocol` method to convert the transaction from the protocol layer to the API layer.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `UnsignedTx` case class?
- The `UnsignedTx` case class represents an unsigned transaction in the Alephium protocol, containing information such as the transaction ID, version, network ID, gas amount, gas price, inputs, and fixed outputs.

2. What is the `toProtocol` method used for?
- The `toProtocol` method is used to convert an `UnsignedTx` instance to an `UnsignedTransaction` instance in the Alephium protocol, performing various validations and conversions along the way.

3. What is the `fromProtocol` method used for?
- The `fromProtocol` method is used to convert an `UnsignedTransaction` instance in the Alephium protocol to an `UnsignedTx` instance, performing various conversions and creating the necessary `AssetInput` and `FixedAssetOutput` instances.
