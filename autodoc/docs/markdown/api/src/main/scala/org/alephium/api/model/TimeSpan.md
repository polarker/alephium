[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/alephium/alephium/blob/master/api/src/main/scala/org/alephium/api/model/TimeSpan.scala)

The code defines a case class called TimeSpan that represents a duration of time in milliseconds. The class takes a Long value as input and stores it as a member variable called millis. The class also has a method called toDuration() that returns a Duration object representing the same duration of time.

This code is part of the alephium project and may be used in various parts of the project where durations of time need to be represented and manipulated. For example, it may be used in the implementation of time-based features such as timeouts or scheduling tasks to run at specific intervals.

Here is an example of how this code may be used:

```scala
import org.alephium.api.model.TimeSpan
import org.alephium.util.Duration

val timeSpan = TimeSpan(5000) // create a TimeSpan object representing 5 seconds
val duration = timeSpan.toDuration() // convert the TimeSpan object to a Duration object
println(duration.getSeconds()) // prints 5
```

In this example, a TimeSpan object is created with a value of 5000, representing 5 seconds. The toDuration() method is then called on the TimeSpan object to convert it to a Duration object. Finally, the getSeconds() method is called on the Duration object to retrieve the number of seconds represented by the duration, which is printed to the console.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `TimeSpan` case class?
   - The `TimeSpan` case class represents a duration of time in milliseconds and provides a method to convert it to a `Duration` object.
2. What is the `Duration` object being imported from?
   - The `Duration` object is being imported from the `org.alephium.util` package.
3. What license is this code released under?
   - This code is released under the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3 or later.
