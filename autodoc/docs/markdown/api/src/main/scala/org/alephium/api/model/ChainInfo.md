[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/alephium/alephium/blob/master/api/src/main/scala/org/alephium/api/model/ChainInfo.scala)

The code above defines a case class called `ChainInfo` which is a part of the `org.alephium.api.model` package. The `ChainInfo` class has a single parameter called `currentHeight` which is an integer representing the current height of the blockchain.

This code is likely used in the larger Alephium project to provide information about the current state of the blockchain to other parts of the system. For example, it could be used by a user interface to display the current height of the blockchain to the user.

Here is an example of how this code could be used:

```scala
import org.alephium.api.model.ChainInfo

val chainInfo = ChainInfo(1000)
println(s"Current blockchain height: ${chainInfo.currentHeight}")
```

In the example above, we create a new instance of the `ChainInfo` class with a current height of 1000. We then print out the current height using string interpolation. The output of this code would be:

```
Current blockchain height: 1000
```

Overall, this code provides a simple and straightforward way to represent the current height of the blockchain in the Alephium project.
