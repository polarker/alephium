[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/alephium/alephium/blob/master/api/src/main/scala/org/alephium/api/model/GetHashesAtHeight.scala)

The code is a part of the Alephium project and is written in Scala. It defines a case class called `GetHashesAtHeight` which takes three parameters: `fromGroup`, `toGroup`, and `height`. The purpose of this case class is to represent a request to get the block hashes at a specific height range for a particular chain.

The `fromGroup` and `toGroup` parameters represent the range of block groups to search for the block hashes. A block group is a set of blocks that are mined together and added to the blockchain at the same time. The `height` parameter represents the height of the block at which the hashes are to be retrieved.

The `PerChain` trait is extended by the `GetHashesAtHeight` case class. This trait is used to indicate that the request is specific to a particular chain. The `PerChain` trait is defined in the `ApiModel` object, which is located in the same package as the `GetHashesAtHeight` case class.

This code can be used in the larger Alephium project to retrieve block hashes for a specific chain at a particular height range. For example, if a user wants to retrieve the block hashes for the Bitcoin chain at height 1000, they can create a `GetHashesAtHeight` object with `fromGroup` and `toGroup` set to the range of block groups that contain block 1000 and the `height` parameter set to 1000. This object can then be passed to a function that retrieves the block hashes for the specified range and height.

Example usage:

```
val request = GetHashesAtHeight(fromGroup = 1, toGroup = 10, height = 1000)
val blockHashes = getBlockHashes(request)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `GetHashesAtHeight` case class?
   - The `GetHashesAtHeight` case class is used to represent a request to retrieve block hashes within a certain height range for a specific chain.
2. What is the significance of the `PerChain` trait that `GetHashesAtHeight` extends?
   - The `PerChain` trait is likely used to indicate that the `GetHashesAtHeight` request is specific to a certain chain within the Alephium project.
3. Are there any other files or dependencies required for this code to function properly?
   - It is unclear from this code snippet whether there are any other files or dependencies required for this code to function properly.
