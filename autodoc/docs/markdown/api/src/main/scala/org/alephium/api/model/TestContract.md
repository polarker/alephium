The `TestContract` class is a model that represents a contract to be tested. It contains various parameters that are used to create a `Complete` instance of the contract, which is used for testing. 

The `TestContract` class takes in various parameters such as `group`, `blockHash`, `blockTimeStamp`, `txId`, `address`, `bytecode`, `initialImmFields`, `initialMutFields`, `initialAsset`, `methodIndex`, `args`, `existingContracts`, and `inputAssets`. These parameters are used to create a `Complete` instance of the contract, which is used for testing. 

The `toComplete()` method is used to create a `Complete` instance of the contract. It first checks if the `methodIndex` is valid and then creates a `Complete` instance of the contract using the parameters passed to the `TestContract` instance. 

The `Complete` class is a model that represents a complete contract that is used for testing. It contains various parameters such as `group`, `blockHash`, `blockTimeStamp`, `txId`, `contractId`, `code`, `originalCodeHash`, `initialImmFields`, `initialMutFields`, `initialAsset`, `testMethodIndex`, `testArgs`, `existingContracts`, and `inputAssets`. 

The `codeHash()` method is used to return the original code hash when testing private methods and the new code hash when the test code is migrated. The `groupIndex()` method is used to return the group index of the contract. 

Overall, this code is used to create a `TestContract` instance that is used for testing a contract. The `TestContract` instance is then converted to a `Complete` instance, which is used for testing.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `TestContract` class?
- The `TestContract` class is used to represent a test contract with various parameters that can be used to test smart contracts.

2. What is the `toComplete()` method used for?
- The `toComplete()` method is used to convert a `TestContract` instance to a `Complete` instance, which includes additional parameters needed for testing.

3. What is the purpose of the `group` parameter in `TestContract` and `Complete`?
- The `group` parameter is used to specify the group index for the contract, which is needed for testing contracts that are part of a group.
