This file contains code for defining the PeerStatus trait and its two case classes, Penalty and Banned. The PeerStatus trait is used to represent the status of a peer in the Alephium network. 

The Penalty case class takes an integer value as its parameter and represents a peer that has been penalized for some reason. The Banned case class takes a TimeStamp object as its parameter and represents a peer that has been banned from the network until a certain time. 

The code also includes the upickle library for serialization and deserialization of the case classes. The upickle library is used to annotate the case classes with keys that will be used during serialization and deserialization. 

This code is used in the larger Alephium project to manage the status of peers in the network. Peers can be penalized or banned for various reasons, such as misbehavior or violating network rules. The PeerStatus trait and its case classes provide a way to represent and manage these different states for peers in the network. 

Example usage of the Penalty case class:
```
val penalty = Penalty(5)
println(penalty.value) // Output: 5
```

Example usage of the Banned case class:
```
val bannedUntil = TimeStamp.now().plusMinutes(30)
val banned = Banned(bannedUntil)
println(banned.until) // Output: current time + 30 minutes
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `PeerStatus` trait and its two case classes?
- The `PeerStatus` trait and its two case classes (`Penalty` and `Banned`) define different statuses that a peer can have in the Alephium network.

2. What is the `TimeStamp` class used for in this code?
- The `TimeStamp` class is used to represent a point in time, specifically in the `Banned` case class to indicate when a peer's ban will be lifted.

3. What is the significance of the `upickle.implicits.key` annotations?
- The `upickle.implicits.key` annotations are used to specify the string keys that will be used when serializing and deserializing the case classes using the upickle library.
