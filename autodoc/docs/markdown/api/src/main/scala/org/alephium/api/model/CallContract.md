The `CallContract` and `MultipleCallContract` classes are part of the Alephium API model and are used to represent a call to a smart contract on the Alephium blockchain. 

The `CallContract` class represents a single call to a smart contract and contains the following fields:
- `group`: an integer representing the group index of the contract
- `worldStateBlockHash`: an optional `BlockHash` representing the block hash of the world state to use for the call
- `txId`: an optional `TransactionId` representing the transaction ID of the call
- `address`: an `Address.Contract` representing the address of the contract to call
- `methodIndex`: an integer representing the index of the method to call on the contract
- `args`: an optional `AVector[Val]` representing the arguments to pass to the method
- `existingContracts`: an optional `AVector[Address.Contract]` representing the addresses of any existing contracts that the called contract depends on
- `inputAssets`: an optional `AVector[TestInputAsset]` representing any input assets to use for the call

The `validate()` method is used to validate the `CallContract` object and ensure that it is valid for execution. It takes a `BrokerConfig` object as an implicit parameter and returns a `Try[GroupIndex]` object. The method first checks that the `group` field is a valid group index. It then constructs a `ChainIndex` object from the `group` field and the same value, and checks that the `worldStateBlockHash` field, if present, corresponds to the constructed `ChainIndex`. If both checks pass, the method returns the `GroupIndex` corresponding to the `ChainIndex`.

The `MultipleCallContract` class represents a list of `CallContract` objects to execute in sequence. It contains a single field `calls`, which is an `AVector[CallContract]` representing the list of calls to execute.

These classes are used in the Alephium API to allow users to interact with smart contracts on the Alephium blockchain. Users can create `CallContract` objects to call methods on smart contracts and pass them to the appropriate API endpoint. The `validate()` method is used to ensure that the call is valid before executing it. The `MultipleCallContract` class is used to execute multiple calls in sequence.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `CallContract` class?
   - The `CallContract` class represents a call to a smart contract on the Alephium blockchain, including the contract address, method index, and optional arguments and input assets.
2. What is the `validate` method used for?
   - The `validate` method is used to validate the `CallContract` instance, checking that the specified group and world state block hash are valid and returning the corresponding `GroupIndex`.
3. What is the `MultipleCallContract` class used for?
   - The `MultipleCallContract` class represents a batch of multiple `CallContract` instances to be executed together on the Alephium blockchain.
