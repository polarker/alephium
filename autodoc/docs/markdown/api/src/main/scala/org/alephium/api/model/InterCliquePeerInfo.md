The code defines a case class called InterCliquePeerInfo which represents information about a peer node in the Alephium network. The class has six fields: cliqueId, brokerId, groupNumPerBroker, address, isSynced, and clientVersion.

The cliqueId field represents the ID of the clique (a group of nodes that work together to validate transactions) that the peer belongs to. The brokerId field represents the ID of the broker (a node that acts as a gateway between cliques) that the peer is connected to. The groupNumPerBroker field represents the number of groups that the broker is responsible for. The address field represents the IP address and port number of the peer. The isSynced field is a boolean that indicates whether the peer is in sync with the rest of the network. The clientVersion field represents the version of the Alephium software that the peer is running.

This class is likely used in the larger Alephium project to represent information about peer nodes in the network. It may be used by other classes or functions to keep track of the state of the network and to make decisions about which nodes to connect to or communicate with.

Example usage:

```scala
val peerInfo = InterCliquePeerInfo(
  cliqueId = CliqueId("abc123"),
  brokerId = 1,
  groupNumPerBroker = 3,
  address = new InetSocketAddress("127.0.0.1", 8080),
  isSynced = true,
  clientVersion = "1.2.3"
)

println(peerInfo.address) // prints "127.0.0.1:8080"
println(peerInfo.isSynced) // prints "true"
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `InterCliquePeerInfo` case class?
   - The `InterCliquePeerInfo` case class is used to represent information about a peer in a specific clique within the Alephium network, including its clique ID, broker ID, group number per broker, network address, synchronization status, and client version.

2. What is the significance of the `CliqueId` type used in the `InterCliquePeerInfo` case class?
   - The `CliqueId` type is used to uniquely identify a clique within the Alephium network, and is used as a parameter in the `InterCliquePeerInfo` case class to specify the clique to which the peer belongs.

3. What is the purpose of the `isSynced` field in the `InterCliquePeerInfo` case class?
   - The `isSynced` field indicates whether the peer is currently synchronized with the rest of the network, and is used to determine whether the peer can be trusted to provide accurate information about the state of the network.
