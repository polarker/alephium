[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/alephium/alephium/blob/master/api/src/main/scala/org/alephium/api/model/HashesAtHeight.scala)

The code defines a case class called `HashesAtHeight` which contains a vector of `BlockHash` objects. This class is located in the `org.alephium.api.model` package.

The purpose of this class is to represent a collection of block hashes at a specific height in the Alephium blockchain. The `BlockHash` class is defined in the `org.alephium.protocol.model` package and represents the hash of a block in the blockchain.

This class may be used in the larger Alephium project to provide information about the blockchain to external applications or services. For example, an API endpoint may return an instance of `HashesAtHeight` to provide a list of block hashes at a specific height to a client application.

Here is an example of how this class may be used:

```scala
import org.alephium.api.model.HashesAtHeight
import org.alephium.protocol.model.BlockHash
import org.alephium.util.AVector

// create a vector of block hashes
val blockHashes = AVector(BlockHash("hash1"), BlockHash("hash2"), BlockHash("hash3"))

// create an instance of HashesAtHeight with the vector of block hashes
val hashesAtHeight = HashesAtHeight(blockHashes)

// access the vector of block hashes
val hashes = hashesAtHeight.headers
``` 

In this example, we create a vector of `BlockHash` objects and use it to create an instance of `HashesAtHeight`. We can then access the vector of block hashes using the `headers` property of the `HashesAtHeight` instance.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `HashesAtHeight` case class?
   - The `HashesAtHeight` case class is used to represent a list of block hashes at a specific height in the Alephium blockchain.

2. What is the `AVector` type used for in this code?
   - The `AVector` type is used to represent an immutable vector data structure that is optimized for efficient random access and updates.

3. What is the significance of the GNU Lesser General Public License mentioned in the code comments?
   - The GNU Lesser General Public License is a type of open source software license that allows for the use, modification, and distribution of the software, but requires that any modifications or derivative works be released under the same license.
