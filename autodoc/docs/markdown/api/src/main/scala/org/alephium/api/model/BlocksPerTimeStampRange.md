[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/alephium/alephium/blob/master/api/src/main/scala/org/alephium/api/model/BlocksPerTimeStampRange.scala)

The code defines a case class called `BlocksPerTimeStampRange` which contains a vector of vectors of `BlockEntry` objects. This class is located in the `org.alephium.api.model` package.

The purpose of this class is to represent a range of blocks that were created within a specific time period. The outer vector represents the time range, with each element being a vector of `BlockEntry` objects that were created during that time period. 

`BlockEntry` is likely another class within the project that represents a single block. The use of a vector allows for efficient indexing and retrieval of blocks within a specific time range.

This class may be used in the larger project to provide an API endpoint that allows users to retrieve blocks within a specific time range. For example, a user may want to retrieve all blocks created within the past hour. The `BlocksPerTimeStampRange` class can be used to efficiently store and retrieve these blocks.

Here is an example of how this class may be used:

```
import org.alephium.api.model.BlocksPerTimeStampRange
import org.alephium.util.AVector

// create a vector of block entries for a specific time range
val blockEntries: AVector[BlockEntry] = ...

// create a vector of vectors of block entries for multiple time ranges
val blocksPerTimeRange: BlocksPerTimeStampRange = BlocksPerTimeStampRange(
  AVector(
    AVector(blockEntries),
    AVector(blockEntries, blockEntries),
    AVector(blockEntries, blockEntries, blockEntries)
  )
)

// retrieve all blocks created within the second time range
val blocksInSecondRange: AVector[BlockEntry] = blocksPerTimeRange.blocks(1)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `BlocksPerTimeStampRange` case class?
   - The `BlocksPerTimeStampRange` case class is used to represent a collection of blocks grouped by timestamp ranges.

2. What is the `AVector` type used for in this code?
   - The `AVector` type is used as a data structure to store collections of `BlockEntry` objects.

3. What is the significance of the GNU Lesser General Public License mentioned in the code comments?
   - The GNU Lesser General Public License is the license under which the alephium project is distributed, allowing for the free distribution and modification of the library under certain conditions.
