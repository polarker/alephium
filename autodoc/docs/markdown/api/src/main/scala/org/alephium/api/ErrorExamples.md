This file defines a trait called `ErrorExamples` that provides examples of different types of errors that can be returned by the Alephium API. The purpose of this trait is to make it easier for developers to understand the structure of error responses and to test their error handling code.

The trait defines several implicit values that are used to generate examples of different types of errors. Each example is an instance of the `Example` class from the `sttp.tapir` library, which is used to define the structure of the error response. The examples are defined using the `simpleExample` method from the `Examples` trait, which takes an instance of an error class and returns a list of examples.

The error classes that are defined in this file include `BadRequest`, `NotFound`, `InternalServerError`, `Unauthorized`, and `ServiceUnavailable`. Each error class takes a message as a parameter, which is used to provide more information about the error. For example, the `NotFound` error is used when a requested resource is not found, and the message parameter is used to specify the name of the missing resource.

Developers can use these examples to test their error handling code by sending requests to the API and verifying that the responses match the expected structure. They can also use the examples to generate documentation for the API, which can help other developers understand how to use the API and how to handle errors that may occur.
