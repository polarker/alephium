This file contains code for defining the different transaction statuses in the Alephium project. The `TxStatus` trait is defined as a sealed trait, which means that all implementations of this trait must be defined in this file. 

There are three implementations of the `TxStatus` trait defined in this file: `Confirmed`, `MemPooled`, and `TxNotFound`. 

The `Confirmed` implementation represents a transaction that has been confirmed on the blockchain. It contains information about the block hash, transaction index, and confirmation counts for the chain, from group, and to group. 

The `MemPooled` implementation represents a transaction that is currently in the mempool, waiting to be confirmed on the blockchain. 

The `TxNotFound` implementation represents a transaction that could not be found on the blockchain. 

These implementations are defined using the `final case class` syntax, which creates immutable classes with a default constructor that takes in the specified parameters. 

The `@upickle.implicits.key` annotation is used to specify the string key that should be used when serializing and deserializing these classes using the upickle library. 

Overall, this code provides a way to represent the different transaction statuses in the Alephium project and can be used throughout the project to handle and display transaction information. 

Example usage:
```
val confirmedTx = Confirmed(blockHash, txIndex, chainConfirmations, fromGroupConfirmations, toGroupConfirmations)
val memPooledTx = MemPooled()
val txNotFound = TxNotFound()
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file defines a sealed trait and three case classes related to transaction status in the Alephium project's API model.

2. What is the significance of the `@upickle.implicits.key` annotation?
- The `@upickle.implicits.key` annotation is used to specify the key name for each case class when serializing and deserializing JSON data using the upickle library.

3. What is the expected behavior of the `Confirmed` case class?
- The `Confirmed` case class represents a confirmed transaction and contains information such as the block hash, transaction index, and confirmation counts.
