This file contains code for the SweepAddressTransaction class, which is a model used in the Alephium project. The purpose of this class is to represent a transaction that sweeps funds from an address. 

The SweepAddressTransaction class has four fields: txId, unsignedTx, gasAmount, and gasPrice. The txId field is a TransactionId object that represents the ID of the transaction. The unsignedTx field is a string that represents the unsigned transaction in hexadecimal format. The gasAmount field is a GasBox object that represents the amount of gas used in the transaction. The gasPrice field is a GasPrice object that represents the price of gas used in the transaction.

The SweepAddressTransaction class also extends the GasInfo trait, which is used to provide information about the gas used in a transaction.

The object SweepAddressTransaction contains a single method, from, which takes an UnsignedTransaction object as input and returns a SweepAddressTransaction object. The purpose of this method is to convert an UnsignedTransaction object into a SweepAddressTransaction object. The method does this by extracting the necessary information from the UnsignedTransaction object and using it to create a new SweepAddressTransaction object.

Overall, the SweepAddressTransaction class and its associated object are used to represent and manipulate transactions that sweep funds from an address in the Alephium project. This class can be used in conjunction with other classes and methods in the project to perform various operations related to transactions. 

Example usage:

```
val unsignedTx = UnsignedTransaction(...)
val sweepTx = SweepAddressTransaction.from(unsignedTx)
println(sweepTx.txId) // prints the ID of the transaction
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SweepAddressTransaction` class?
   - The `SweepAddressTransaction` class represents a transaction that sweeps all funds from a given address to another address.
2. What is the `from` method in the `SweepAddressTransaction` object used for?
   - The `from` method is used to create a `SweepAddressTransaction` instance from an `UnsignedTransaction` instance by extracting relevant information such as transaction ID, gas amount, gas price, and serializing the unsigned transaction.
3. What is the `GasInfo` trait that `SweepAddressTransaction` extends?
   - The `GasInfo` trait is not defined in the given code, so a super smart developer might wonder where it is defined and what other classes or traits extend it.
