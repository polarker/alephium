The code defines a set of error classes that can be used in the Alephium API. These error classes are used to represent different HTTP status codes that can be returned by the API. The error classes are defined as case classes that extend the `ApiError` trait. Each error class has a `detail` field that contains a string describing the error.

The `ApiError` object contains a set of companion objects, one for each error class. Each companion object extends the `Companion` trait, which defines a set of methods and fields that are used to generate the error response. The `Companion` trait defines a `statusCode` field that contains the HTTP status code associated with the error. It also defines a `description` field that contains a string describing the error class.

Each companion object also defines an `apply` method that takes a `detail` string and returns an instance of the error class. The companion object also defines a `readerE` method that is used to deserialize the error response from JSON. The `specificFields` method is used to define any additional fields that should be included in the error response. Finally, the companion object defines a `schema` field that contains the Tapir schema for the error response.

The `ApiError` object also defines a set of case classes that represent different HTTP status codes. These case classes are used to define the status codes that can be returned by the API. Each case class extends the `StatusCode` trait and has a `type` field that contains the HTTP status code.

The `ApiError` object is used to generate error responses in the Alephium API. When an error occurs, the appropriate error class is instantiated with a `detail` string describing the error. The error response is then serialized to JSON using the Tapir library. The `schema` field of the companion object is used to generate the JSON schema for the error response.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    
    This code defines a set of case classes that represent different types of API errors, along with their corresponding HTTP status codes and error messages.

2. What is the purpose of the `specificFields` method in the `Companion` class?
    
    The `specificFields` method allows subclasses of `ApiError` to define additional fields that should be included in the JSON representation of the error. This is useful for cases where an error message needs to include additional context or metadata.

3. What is the purpose of the `schema` property in each `Companion` object?
    
    The `schema` property defines a Tapir schema for the corresponding `ApiError` subclass, which is used to generate documentation and validation for the error response. The schema includes a `detail` field for the error message, as well as any additional fields defined by the `specificFields` method.
