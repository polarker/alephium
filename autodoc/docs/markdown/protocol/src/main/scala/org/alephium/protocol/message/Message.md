The `Message` object and its companion object in the `org.alephium.protocol.message` package provide functionality for serializing and deserializing messages that conform to a specific protocol. The protocol is defined as follows:

```
4 bytes: Header
4 bytes: Payload's length
4 bytes: Checksum
? bytes: Payload
```

The `Message` object is a case class that represents a message with a header and a payload. The `Header` object is defined elsewhere in the `org.alephium.protocol.message` package and contains a single field, `wireVersion`, which is an integer that specifies the version of the protocol being used.

The `Message` object provides two `apply` methods that can be used to create a `Message` object from a payload. One of these methods takes a payload of any type that extends the `Payload` trait, while the other takes a payload of a specific type. Both methods create a new `Header` object with the current wire version and use it to construct a new `Message` object.

The `Message` object also provides two `serialize` methods that can be used to serialize a `Message` object to a `ByteString`. One of these methods takes a `Message` object directly, while the other takes a payload of any type that extends the `Payload` trait and constructs a new `Message` object from it. Both methods use the `MessageSerde` object to serialize the header and payload, calculate the checksum and length of the serialized data, and concatenate the magic bytes, checksum, length, and serialized data into a single `ByteString`.

The `Message` object also provides a `deserialize` method that can be used to deserialize a `ByteString` into a `Message` object. This method uses the `MessageSerde` object to extract the checksum, length, and serialized data from the input `ByteString`, check the checksum, deserialize the header, and deserialize the payload. If the deserialization is successful, the method returns a `SerdeResult` object containing the deserialized `Message` object and any remaining bytes in the input `ByteString`. If there are any remaining bytes, the method returns a `SerdeError` object indicating that the input `ByteString` is not in the correct format.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Message` class and how is it used?
   - The `Message` class represents a message with a header, payload, and checksum, and it can be serialized and deserialized using the `serialize` and `deserialize` methods respectively.
2. What is the `Payload` class and how is it serialized?
   - The `Payload` class is a trait that represents the payload of a message, and it can be serialized using the `Payload.serialize` method.
3. What is the purpose of the `networkConfig` parameter in the `serialize` and `deserialize` methods?
   - The `networkConfig` parameter is used to obtain the magic bytes for the network, which are included in the serialized message.
