This file contains code related to the storage of smart contract states in the Alephium blockchain. The `ContractState` trait is defined, which represents the state of a smart contract. It contains information such as the hash of the contract code, the hash of the initial state, and the immutable and mutable fields of the contract. 

The `ContractStorageState` trait is also defined, which is a sealed trait that represents the storage state of a contract. It has two implementations: `ContractLegacyState` and `ContractMutableState`. `ContractLegacyState` is used for legacy contracts, while `ContractMutableState` is used for new contracts. 

The `ContractImmutableState` case class represents the immutable state of a contract, which includes the code hash, the initial state hash, and the immutable fields. The `ContractMutableState` case class represents the mutable state of a contract, which includes the mutable fields and the contract output reference. 

The `ContractNewState` case class represents the state of a new contract, which includes both the immutable and mutable states. It has methods to update the mutable fields and the contract output reference. It also has a `migrate` method that is used to migrate a contract to a new version. 

The `ContractLegacyState` case class represents the state of a legacy contract, which includes the code hash, the initial state hash, the mutable fields, and the contract output reference. It has methods to update the mutable fields and the contract output reference. 

The `ContractStorageState` object contains the serialization and deserialization logic for `ContractStorageState`. It has a `serde` field that is used to serialize and deserialize `ContractStorageState`. 

Overall, this code is used to manage the storage of smart contract states in the Alephium blockchain. It provides a way to represent the state of a contract, serialize and deserialize the state, and update the state when necessary. It is an important part of the Alephium blockchain, as it enables the execution and storage of smart contracts. 

Example usage:

```scala
val codeHash: Hash = ...
val initialStateHash: Hash = ...
val immFields: AVector[Val] = ...
val mutFields: AVector[Val] = ...
val contractOutputRef: ContractOutputRef = ...

// Create a new contract state
val newState = ContractNewState.unsafe(
  StatefulContract.HalfDecoded(codeHash),
  immFields,
  mutFields,
  contractOutputRef
)

// Update the mutable fields of the contract
val newMutFields: AVector[Val] = ...
val updatedState = newState.updateMutFieldsUnsafe(newMutFields)

// Update the contract output reference
val newOutputRef: ContractOutputRef = ...
val updatedState2 = updatedState.updateOutputRef(newOutputRef)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ContractState` trait and its implementations?
- The `ContractState` trait defines the common properties and methods of contract states, while its implementations (`ContractLegacyState` and `ContractNewState`) represent different versions of contract states with different fields and behaviors.

2. What is the purpose of the `ContractStorageState` trait and its implementations?
- The `ContractStorageState` trait defines the common properties of contract storage states, while its implementations (`ContractLegacyState` and `ContractMutableState`) represent different versions of contract storage states with different fields and behaviors.

3. What is the purpose of the `serde` objects and how are they used?
- The `serde` objects define the serialization and deserialization logic for the different types and traits used in the code, and they are used to convert instances of these types to and from `ByteString` objects. They are used implicitly by the `serialize` and `_deserialize` methods defined in the `Serde` trait.
