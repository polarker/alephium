The code above defines a trait called `DiscoveryConfig` which contains various configuration parameters related to peer discovery in the Alephium project. 

The `scanFrequency` parameter defines the wait time between two scans, while `scanFastFrequency` and `fastScanPeriod` are used to configure a faster scan period for initial peer discovery. The `initialDiscoveryPeriod` parameter is used to set the duration of the initial discovery phase. 

The `neighborsPerGroup` parameter sets the maximum number of peers returned from a query, while `maxCliqueFromSameIp` sets the maximum number of peers that can be connected from the same IP address. 

The `peersTimeout` parameter sets the timeout duration for peer connections, while `expireDuration` sets the duration after which a peer is considered expired and removed from the list of known peers. The `unreachableDuration` parameter sets the duration after which a peer is considered unreachable. 

This trait is likely used by other components in the Alephium project that are responsible for peer discovery and management. For example, a peer discovery module may use these configuration parameters to determine how often to scan for new peers, how many peers to query at a time, and how long to wait before considering a peer unreachable. 

Here is an example of how this trait may be used in a hypothetical peer discovery module:

```scala
import org.alephium.protocol.config.DiscoveryConfig

class PeerDiscovery(config: DiscoveryConfig) {
  def discoverPeers(): List[Peer] = {
    // Perform initial discovery phase using fast scan period
    val initialPeers = scanPeers(config.fastScanPeriod)

    // Continuously scan for new peers using regular scan period
    while (true) {
      val newPeers = scanPeers(config.scanFrequency)
      addPeers(newPeers)
      Thread.sleep(config.scanFrequency.toMillis)
    }

    // ...
  }

  private def scanPeers(duration: Duration): List[Peer] = {
    // Perform peer discovery scan and return list of peers
    // ...
  }

  private def addPeers(peers: List[Peer]): Unit = {
    // Add new peers to list of known peers
    // ...
  }
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `DiscoveryConfig` trait?
- The `DiscoveryConfig` trait defines a set of configuration parameters related to peer discovery in the Alephium protocol.

2. What is the difference between `scanFrequency` and `scanFastFrequency`?
- `scanFrequency` defines the wait time between two scans, while `scanFastFrequency` defines the wait time between two fast scans. Fast scans are used to discover new peers more quickly.

3. What is the meaning of `maxCliqueFromSameIp`?
- `maxCliqueFromSameIp` defines the maximum number of peers that can be discovered from the same IP address. This is used to prevent a single IP address from dominating the peer network.
