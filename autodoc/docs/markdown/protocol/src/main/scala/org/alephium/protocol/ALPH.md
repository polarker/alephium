The `ALPH` object in the `org.alephium.protocol` package contains various constants and utility methods related to the Alephium cryptocurrency. 

The object defines several constants related to the value of the currency, including the number of coins in one ALPH, one cent, and one nanoALPH. It also defines the maximum value of an ALPH coin and the height, weight, and timestamp of the genesis block of the blockchain. Additionally, it defines several constants related to the difficulty bomb, which is a mechanism that increases the difficulty of mining over time to prevent the creation of too many coins too quickly. 

The object also defines several utility methods for converting between different units of the currency, including `alph`, `cent`, and `nanoAlph`. These methods take a long or U256 value representing an amount of the currency and return the corresponding value in ALPH, cents, or nanoALPH. There is also a method `alphFromString` that takes a string in the format "x.x ALPH" and returns the corresponding value in ALPH as a U256. 

Overall, the `ALPH` object provides a central location for constants and utility methods related to the Alephium cryptocurrency, making it easier for other parts of the project to use and manipulate the currency. For example, other parts of the project might use the `alph` method to convert between different units of the currency or the `MaxTxInputNum` constant to limit the number of inputs in a transaction.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ALPH` object?
- The `ALPH` object contains constants and utility functions related to the Alephium protocol, such as conversion functions between different units of the protocol's currency and various protocol parameters.

2. What is the significance of the `GenesisTimestamp` and `LaunchTimestamp` values?
- `GenesisTimestamp` represents the timestamp of the Bitcoin genesis block, which is used as a reference point for the Alephium protocol. `LaunchTimestamp` represents the timestamp of the Alephium protocol launch, which is used to calculate various protocol parameters.

3. What is the purpose of the `alphFromString` function?
- The `alphFromString` function parses a string representation of a decimal number followed by the "ALPH" unit suffix and returns an `Option[U256]` representing the corresponding amount in the protocol's currency. If the string is not a valid representation or the resulting value has too many decimal places, the function returns `None`.
