This file contains the implementation of the RequestId class and its companion object. The RequestId class is a simple wrapper around an unsigned 32-bit integer value, and it is used to uniquely identify requests in the Alephium protocol.

The RequestId class has a single field, `value`, which is an instance of the U32 class. The U32 class is a wrapper around an unsigned 32-bit integer value, and it provides various utility methods for working with unsigned integers. The RequestId class also has a `toString` method that returns a string representation of the request ID.

The companion object of the RequestId class provides two methods: `unsafe` and `random`. The `unsafe` method creates a new RequestId instance from an integer value. This method is marked as unsafe because it does not perform any bounds checking on the input value, and it may throw an exception if the value is negative or greater than 2^32-1. The `random` method generates a new random RequestId instance using a secure and slow random number generator.

The RequestId class is used throughout the Alephium protocol to uniquely identify requests and match them with their corresponding responses. For example, when a node sends a request to another node, it includes a RequestId in the request message. When the receiving node processes the request and sends back a response, it includes the same RequestId in the response message. This allows the sending node to match the response with the original request and handle it appropriately.

Here is an example of how to use the RequestId class:

```scala
val requestId = RequestId.random()
println(requestId.toString()) // prints something like "RequestId: 1234567890"
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `RequestId` class?
   - The `RequestId` class is used to represent a request ID with an underlying `U32` value and has methods for serialization and generating random IDs.
2. What is the `Serde` object used for?
   - The `Serde` object is used for serialization and deserialization of `RequestId` objects.
3. What is the `SecureAndSlowRandom` object used for?
   - The `SecureAndSlowRandom` object is used to generate a random `U32` value for the `RequestId` object's `random()` method.
