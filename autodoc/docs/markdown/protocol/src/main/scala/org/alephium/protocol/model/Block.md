This file contains the implementation of the `Block` class and its companion object. The `Block` class represents a block in the Alephium blockchain. It contains a header and a list of transactions. The header contains metadata about the block, such as the block's hash, the chain index, the timestamp, the target, and the nonce. The list of transactions contains the transactions included in the block. 

The `Block` class has several methods that allow access to its properties. For example, the `hash` method returns the hash of the block, the `coinbase` method returns the coinbase transaction, and the `nonCoinbase` method returns a vector of all non-coinbase transactions. The `getScriptExecutionOrder` method returns a vector of indexes that specifies the order in which the non-coinbase transactions should be executed. This method shuffles the transactions randomly to mitigate front-running. 

The companion object contains several methods for creating and manipulating blocks. The `from` method creates a block from a list of transactions, a target, a timestamp, and a nonce. The `genesis` method creates a genesis block. The `getScriptExecutionOrder` and `getNonCoinbaseExecutionOrder` methods return the order in which the non-coinbase transactions should be executed. These methods shuffle the transactions randomly to mitigate front-running. 

Overall, this file is an essential part of the Alephium blockchain project as it provides the implementation of the `Block` class and its companion object, which are fundamental components of the blockchain. Developers can use this file to create, manipulate, and access blocks in the Alephium blockchain.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Block` class and what does it contain?
- The `Block` class represents a block in the Alephium blockchain and contains a header, a list of transactions, and various methods for accessing and manipulating block data.

2. What is the `getScriptExecutionOrder` method used for and how does it work?
- The `getScriptExecutionOrder` method shuffles the order in which transactions with scripts are executed in a block to mitigate front-running. It does this by randomly shuffling the indexes of transactions with scripts and then executing them in that order.

3. What is the purpose of the `hardFork` parameter in the `getScriptExecutionOrder` and `getNonCoinbaseExecutionOrder` methods?
- The `hardFork` parameter is used to determine whether a hard fork has occurred and whether to use the new or old execution order. If the hard fork has not occurred, the old execution order is used, otherwise the new execution order is used.
