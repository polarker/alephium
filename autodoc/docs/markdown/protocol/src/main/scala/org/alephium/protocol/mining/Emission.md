The `Emission` class in the `org.alephium.protocol.mining` package is responsible for calculating the mining rewards for the Alephium blockchain. The class takes in the `blockTargetTime` and `groupConfig` as parameters and calculates the mining rewards based on these values.

The `Emission` class has several methods and properties that are used to calculate the mining rewards. The `shareReward` method takes an amount and divides it by the number of chains in the group to get the reward per chain. The `reward` method takes a `BlockHeader` or a `Target` and calculates the mining reward based on the timestamp and target. If the target is less than `oneEhPerSecondTarget`, then the `PoLW` reward is calculated, otherwise, the `PoW` reward is calculated. The `rewardWrtTime` method calculates the mining reward based on the time elapsed since the launch of the blockchain. The `rewardWrtHashRate` method calculates the mining reward based on the hash rate of the miner. The `rewardWrtTarget` method calculates the mining reward based on the target of the miner.

The `Emission` class also has several properties that are used to calculate the mining rewards. The `initialMaxRewardPerChain` property is the initial maximum reward per chain. The `stableMaxRewardPerChain` property is the stable maximum reward per chain. The `lowHashRateInitialRewardPerChain` property is the initial reward per chain for low hash rates. The `onePhPerSecondTarget`, `oneEhPerSecondTarget`, and `a128EhPerSecondTarget` properties are the targets for 1 PH/s, 1 EH/s, and 128 EH/s respectively. The `yearlyCentsDropUntilStable` property is the yearly drop in cents until the reward becomes stable. The `blocksToDropAboutOneCent` property is the number of blocks it takes to drop the reward by about one cent. The `durationToDropAboutOnceCent` property is the duration it takes to drop the reward by about one cent.

The `Emission` class also has several methods that are used to calculate the rewards per year and rewards per target. The `rewardsWrtTime` method calculates the rewards per year based on the time elapsed since the launch of the blockchain. The `rewardsWrtTarget` method calculates the rewards per year based on the target of the miner.

Overall, the `Emission` class is an important part of the Alephium blockchain as it is responsible for calculating the mining rewards. The class takes into account the time elapsed since the launch of the blockchain, the hash rate of the miner, and the target of the miner to calculate the mining rewards. The rewards are calculated based on several properties and methods that take into account the stability of the reward and the drop in reward over time.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Emission` class?
- The `Emission` class is responsible for calculating mining rewards for the Alephium blockchain based on various factors such as time, hashrate, and target.

2. What is the significance of the `blockTargetTime` parameter?
- The `blockTargetTime` parameter represents the target time for generating a new block in the Alephium blockchain. It is used in various calculations to determine mining rewards.

3. What is the difference between `PoW` and `PoLW` in the `RewardType` trait?
- `PoW` represents a mining reward for proof-of-work mining, while `PoLW` represents a mining reward for proof-of-work and proof-of-locked-wallet combined mining. The `PoLW` reward includes a burnt amount that is calculated based on the difference between the target and the oneEhPerSecondTarget.
