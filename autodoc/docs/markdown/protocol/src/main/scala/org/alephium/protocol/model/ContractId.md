This file contains the implementation of the `ContractId` class and its companion object. The `ContractId` class represents the identifier of a smart contract in the Alephium blockchain. It is a wrapper around a `Hash` value and is defined as a value class, which means that it has no runtime overhead. 

The `ContractId` class provides several methods to manipulate contract identifiers. The `bytes` method returns the byte representation of the identifier. The `groupIndex` method returns the index of the group to which the contract belongs, based on the last byte of its identifier. The `subContractId` method returns a new contract identifier that represents a sub-contract of the current contract, based on a given path and group index. The `inaccurateFirstOutputRef` method returns the first output reference of the contract, which cannot be accurately computed since a network upgrade.

The companion object of the `ContractId` class provides several factory methods to create contract identifiers. The `generate` method creates a new random identifier. The `from` method creates an identifier from a byte string, if possible. The `deprecatedFrom` method creates an identifier from a transaction identifier and an output index, using a deprecated algorithm. The `from` method creates an identifier from a transaction identifier, an output index, and a group index, using a new algorithm. The `deprecatedSubContract` method creates a new sub-contract identifier from a pre-image, using a deprecated algorithm. The `subContract` method creates a new sub-contract identifier from a pre-image and a group index, using a new algorithm. The `hash` methods create a new identifier from a byte sequence or a string. The `unsafe` method creates a new identifier from a hash value.

Overall, the `ContractId` class and its companion object are essential components of the Alephium blockchain, as they provide a way to uniquely identify smart contracts and their sub-contracts. They are used extensively throughout the codebase to implement various features, such as contract creation, contract execution, and contract storage. Here is an example of how to create a new contract identifier:

```scala
import org.alephium.protocol.model.ContractId

val contractId = ContractId.generate
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ContractId` class and how is it used in the `alephium` project?
   - The `ContractId` class represents a unique identifier for a smart contract in the `alephium` project. It is used to generate, manipulate, and retrieve contract IDs from transaction IDs and output indices.
2. What is the significance of the `groupIndex` method in the `ContractId` class?
   - The `groupIndex` method returns the group index associated with a contract ID, which is used to determine the shard on which the contract is stored in the `alephium` network.
3. What is the purpose of the `lemanUnsafe` method in the `ContractId` object?
   - The `lemanUnsafe` method is used to generate a new contract ID from a deprecated contract ID and a group index, as part of a network upgrade in the `alephium` project. It is marked as unsafe because it assumes that the deprecated contract ID has a certain format that may not be true in all cases.
