The code above defines a case class called `DiscoveryVersion` and an object with the same name. The case class takes an integer value as its parameter and extends `AnyVal`, which means that it is a value class and will be represented as an integer at runtime. The object contains an implicit `Serde` instance for `DiscoveryVersion` and a `currentDiscoveryVersion` value.

The `Serde` instance is used for serialization and deserialization of `DiscoveryVersion` instances. It is defined using the `forProduct1` method of the `Serde` companion object, which takes two parameters: a function to create a new instance of the case class from a single value, and a function to extract the value from an instance of the case class. In this case, the `apply` method of the `DiscoveryVersion` companion object is used to create a new instance of the case class from an integer value, and the `value` field of the case class is used to extract the integer value from an instance of the case class.

The `currentDiscoveryVersion` value is a `DiscoveryVersion` instance that represents the current version of the discovery protocol used by the Alephium project. It is defined as an object that extends `DiscoveryVersion` and has a value of `CurrentDiscoveryVersion`. The value of `CurrentDiscoveryVersion` is not defined in this file, but is likely defined elsewhere in the project.

This code is used to define the `DiscoveryVersion` type and provide serialization and deserialization support for it. It is likely used in other parts of the Alephium project to represent and communicate the version of the discovery protocol being used. For example, it may be used in network messages to indicate the version of the discovery protocol being used by a node.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `DiscoveryVersion` case class?
   - The `DiscoveryVersion` case class is used to represent a version number for discovery protocol.
2. What is the `Serde` import used for?
   - The `Serde` import is used for serialization and deserialization of objects.
3. What is the `currentDiscoveryVersion` object used for?
   - The `currentDiscoveryVersion` object is used to represent the current version of the discovery protocol.
