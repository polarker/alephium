This file contains the implementation of the `TxOutput` trait and its two subtypes, `AssetOutput` and `ContractOutput`. These classes represent the output of a transaction in the Alephium blockchain. 

The `TxOutput` trait defines several methods and properties that are common to both `AssetOutput` and `ContractOutput`. These include `amount`, which represents the number of ALPH tokens in the output, `lockupScript`, which is the script that guards the output, and `tokens`, which is a vector of secondary tokens in the output. The `hint` method returns a `Hint` object that can be used to optimize transaction validation. Finally, the `payGasUnsafe` method returns a new `TxOutput` object with the specified fee subtracted from the `amount`.

The `AssetOutput` class represents an output that contains ALPH tokens and possibly other secondary tokens. It contains an additional property `additionalData`, which is a payload for additional information. The `isAsset` property returns `true` for `AssetOutput` objects.

The `ContractOutput` class represents an output that contains a contract. It does not contain any secondary tokens or additional data. The `isAsset` property returns `false` for `ContractOutput` objects.

The `TxOutput` object contains several factory methods for creating `TxOutput` objects. The `from` method creates a vector of `TxOutput` objects from the specified `amount`, `tokens`, and `lockupScript`. The `fromDeprecated` method creates a `TxOutput` object from the specified `amount`, `tokens`, and `lockupScript`. The `asset` method creates an `AssetOutput` object with the specified `amount`, `lockupScript`, and `tokens`. The `contract` method creates a `ContractOutput` object with the specified `amount` and `lockupScript`. The `genesis` method creates an `AssetOutput` object with the specified `amount`, `lockupScript`, `lockupDuration`, and `data`. Finally, the `forSMT` method returns a `ContractOutput` object with a single ALPH token and a lockup script that corresponds to the zero contract ID.

The `TxOutput` object also contains an implicit `serde` object that defines how `TxOutput` objects are serialized and deserialized. The `serde` object uses the `eitherSerde` method to serialize and deserialize `AssetOutput` and `ContractOutput` objects.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `TxOutput` trait and its subclasses `AssetOutput` and `ContractOutput`?
- The `TxOutput` trait represents the output of a transaction, and its subclasses `AssetOutput` and `ContractOutput` represent asset and contract outputs respectively.
2. What is the purpose of the `from` methods in the `TxOutput` object?
- The `from` methods are used to create a vector of `TxOutput` objects from an amount, a vector of tokens, and a lockup script. There are two overloaded versions of the method, one with a lock time parameter and one without.
3. What is the purpose of the `genesis` method in the `TxOutput` object?
- The `genesis` method is used to create an `AssetOutput` object representing the output of a genesis transaction, which is the first transaction in a blockchain. It takes an amount, a lockup script, a lockup duration, and additional data as parameters.
