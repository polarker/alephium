The code above defines a case class called `WalletDeletion` that takes a single parameter `password` of type `String`. This case class is located in the `org.alephium.wallet.api.model` package.

The purpose of this code is to provide a data model for deleting a wallet in the Alephium project. The `WalletDeletion` case class is used to encapsulate the password required to delete a wallet. This password is passed as a parameter to the `WalletDeletion` case class.

This code is likely used in conjunction with other code in the Alephium project to provide functionality for deleting a wallet. For example, a method in another class may take an instance of `WalletDeletion` as a parameter and use the password contained within it to delete the corresponding wallet.

Here is an example of how this code may be used in the larger project:

```scala
import org.alephium.wallet.api.model.WalletDeletion

class WalletManager {
  def deleteWallet(walletDeletion: WalletDeletion): Unit = {
    // code to delete wallet using password from walletDeletion
  }
}

val password = "myPassword"
val walletDeletion = WalletDeletion(password)
val walletManager = new WalletManager()
walletManager.deleteWallet(walletDeletion)
```

In the example above, an instance of `WalletDeletion` is created with the password "myPassword". This instance is then passed as a parameter to the `deleteWallet` method of a `WalletManager` instance. The `deleteWallet` method would then use the password contained within the `walletDeletion` parameter to delete the corresponding wallet.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `WalletDeletion` case class?
- The `WalletDeletion` case class is used to represent a request to delete a wallet, and it contains a password field.

2. What is the significance of the `final` keyword before the `case class` declaration?
- The `final` keyword indicates that the `WalletDeletion` case class cannot be extended or subclassed.

3. What is the intended use of this code within the `alephium` project?
- This code is part of the `org.alephium.wallet.api.model` package, and it likely serves as a model for handling wallet deletion requests within the Alephium wallet API.
