[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/alephium/alephium/blob/master/wallet/src/main/scala/org/alephium/wallet/api/model/RevealMnemonic.scala)

The code above defines two case classes, `RevealMnemonic` and `RevealMnemonicResult`, which are used in the `org.alephium.wallet.api` package of the Alephium project. 

The `RevealMnemonic` case class takes a single parameter, `password`, which is a string. This case class is used to represent a request to reveal the mnemonic associated with a particular password. 

The `RevealMnemonicResult` case class takes a single parameter, `mnemonic`, which is an instance of the `Mnemonic` class defined in the `org.alephium.crypto.wallet` package. This case class is used to represent the result of a successful request to reveal the mnemonic associated with a particular password. 

The `Mnemonic` class is used to generate and manage mnemonic phrases, which are used to derive private keys for cryptocurrency wallets. The `RevealMnemonic` and `RevealMnemonicResult` case classes are likely used in the context of a wallet application, where a user can enter their password to reveal their mnemonic phrase and gain access to their wallet. 

Here is an example of how these case classes might be used in a wallet application:

```scala
import org.alephium.wallet.api.model._

val password = "mysecretpassword"
val revealRequest = RevealMnemonic(password)
val mnemonicResult = RevealMnemonicResult(Mnemonic.generate())
// In a real application, the Mnemonic instance would be generated from the user's encrypted wallet data

// Send the reveal request to the server and receive the result
val serverResponse = sendRevealRequestToServer(revealRequest)
val result = parseServerResponse(serverResponse)

// If the request was successful, display the user's mnemonic phrase
result match {
  case RevealMnemonicResult(mnemonic) => println(s"Your mnemonic phrase is: ${mnemonic.phrase}")
  case _ => println("Error: Failed to reveal mnemonic phrase")
}
``` 

Overall, the `RevealMnemonic` and `RevealMnemonicResult` case classes provide a simple and type-safe way to represent requests and responses for revealing mnemonic phrases in the context of a cryptocurrency wallet application.
## Questions:
