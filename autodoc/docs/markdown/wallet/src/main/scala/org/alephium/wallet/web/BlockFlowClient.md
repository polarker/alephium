The `BlockFlowClient` is a trait that defines an interface for interacting with the Alephium blockchain. It provides methods for fetching balances, preparing transactions, and posting transactions to the blockchain. 

The `BlockFlowClient` is implemented by the `Impl` class, which takes in a default URI, a maximum age for cached responses, an optional API key, and an `EndpointSender` instance. The `EndpointSender` is responsible for sending HTTP requests to the Alephium blockchain. 

The `Impl` class also defines several private methods for sending requests to specific groups within the blockchain. These methods take in a `GroupIndex`, an `Endpoint`, and some parameters, and return a `Future` that resolves to an `Either` containing an `ApiError` or the result of the request. 

The `fetchBalance` method takes in an `Address.Asset` and returns a `Future` that resolves to an `Either` containing an `ApiError` or a tuple of the balance, locked balance, and an optional warning message for the specified address. 

The `prepareTransaction` method takes in a `PublicKey`, a vector of `Destination`s, and optional `GasBox`, `GasPrice`, and `utxosLimit` parameters, and returns a `Future` that resolves to an `Either` containing an `ApiError` or a `BuildTransactionResult`. The `BuildTransactionResult` contains the transaction details needed to sign and post the transaction to the blockchain. 

The `prepareSweepActiveAddressTransaction` method is similar to `prepareTransaction`, but is used specifically for sweeping funds from an active address. It takes in a `PublicKey`, an `Address.Asset`, an optional `TimeStamp` for the lock time, and optional `GasBox`, `GasPrice`, and `utxosLimit` parameters, and returns a `Future` that resolves to an `Either` containing an `ApiError` or a `BuildSweepAddressTransactionsResult`. The `BuildSweepAddressTransactionsResult` contains the transaction details needed to sign and post the transaction to the blockchain. 

The `postTransaction` method takes in a transaction string, a `Signature`, and a `fromGroup` parameter, and returns a `Future` that resolves to an `Either` containing an `ApiError` or a `SubmitTxResult`. The `SubmitTxResult` contains the transaction hash and the status of the transaction. 

Overall, the `BlockFlowClient` provides a high-level interface for interacting with the Alephium blockchain, allowing developers to easily fetch balances and prepare and post transactions. The `Impl` class handles the low-level details of sending requests to the blockchain and parsing the responses.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `BlockFlowClient` trait and what methods does it define?
- The `BlockFlowClient` trait defines methods for fetching balance, preparing transactions, and posting transactions for the Alephium blockchain.
2. What is the purpose of the `Impl` class and how is it related to the `BlockFlowClient` trait?
- The `Impl` class is an implementation of the `BlockFlowClient` trait that defines the behavior of the methods in the trait. It takes in parameters such as the default URI and endpoint sender to perform the necessary actions.
3. What is the purpose of the `uriFromGroup` method and how is it used in the `requestFromGroup` method?
- The `uriFromGroup` method takes in a group index and returns the URI of the peer associated with that group. It is used in the `requestFromGroup` method to send requests to the appropriate peer based on the group index of the address or lockup script.
