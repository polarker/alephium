The `WalletApp` class is a component of the Alephium project that provides a wallet service. It is responsible for starting and stopping a web server that listens for HTTP requests on a specified port. The server is built using the Vert.x framework and is configured to handle CORS requests. The server routes incoming requests to the appropriate handlers, which are defined in the `WalletServer` class.

The `WalletApp` class initializes several other components that are used by the `WalletServer` to handle requests. These include a `BlockFlowClient` instance, which is used to communicate with the Alephium network, and a `WalletService` instance, which is used to manage wallet accounts. The `WalletServer` class defines several routes that are used to handle requests related to wallet management, such as creating new accounts, transferring funds, and retrieving account balances.

The `WalletApp` class is designed to be used as a standalone application or as a component of a larger system. When used as a standalone application, it can be started by creating an instance of the `WalletApp` class and calling its `start` method. This will start the web server and begin listening for incoming requests. When used as a component of a larger system, the `WalletApp` class can be integrated into the system by creating an instance of the class and calling its `routes` method to obtain a list of routes that can be added to the system's main router.

Here is an example of how the `WalletApp` class can be used to start a standalone wallet service:

```scala
val config = WalletConfig(...) // create a configuration object
val walletApp = new WalletApp(config)
walletApp.start() // start the web server
```

Overall, the `WalletApp` class provides a convenient way to create and manage a wallet service that can be integrated into a larger system or used as a standalone application.
