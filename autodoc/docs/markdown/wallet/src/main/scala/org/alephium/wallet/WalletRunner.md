The `Main` object in this file is the entry point for the Alephium wallet application. It extends the `App` trait, which provides a convenient way to define a `main` method. The `Main` object also extends the `Service` trait, which is a custom trait defined in the Alephium project that provides a way to start and stop services.

The `Main` object first loads a configuration file using the Typesafe Config library. It then extracts a `WalletConfig` object from the configuration file using the Ficus library. The `WalletConfig` object contains various configuration parameters for the wallet application, such as the network to connect to and the location of the wallet file.

Next, the `Main` object creates a `WalletApp` object using the `WalletConfig` object. The `WalletApp` object is the main service of the wallet application and is responsible for managing the wallet and communicating with the Alephium network.

The `Main` object then defines two methods: `startSelfOnce` and `stopSelfOnce`. These methods are called by the `Service` trait when the service is started and stopped, respectively. In this case, the `startSelfOnce` method simply returns a successful `Future`, indicating that the service has started successfully. The `stopSelfOnce` method also returns a successful `Future`, indicating that the service has stopped successfully.

Finally, the `Main` object starts the `WalletApp` service by calling the `start` method. It then registers a shutdown hook that stops the `WalletApp` service when the application is terminated. If the `start` method completes successfully, the `Main` object does nothing. If the `start` method fails, the `Main` object logs an error and stops the service.

Overall, this file provides the main entry point for the Alephium wallet application and sets up the necessary configuration and services. It can be used to start the wallet application and manage the wallet and network connections.
