The code defines a trait called `WalletDocumentation` that provides documentation for the wallet-related endpoints of the Alephium project. The trait extends `WalletEndpoints`, which defines the actual endpoints, and `OpenAPIDocsInterpreter`, which is a library for generating OpenAPI documentation.

The `walletEndpoints` value is a list of all the wallet-related endpoints defined in `WalletEndpoints`. Each endpoint is mapped to its `endpoint` property, which is of type `Endpoint[_, _, _, _, _]`. This type represents an HTTP endpoint, and is defined by the `tapir` library. The five type parameters correspond to the request input, request output, error output, response output, and streams, respectively.

The `walletOpenAPI` value is a lazy val that generates an OpenAPI documentation object from the `walletEndpoints` list. The `toOpenAPI` method is provided by `OpenAPIDocsInterpreter`, and takes the list of endpoints, a title for the API, and a version string as arguments. The resulting `OpenAPI` object can be used to generate documentation in various formats, such as JSON or YAML.

Overall, this code provides a convenient way to generate documentation for the wallet-related endpoints of the Alephium project. By defining the endpoints in a separate trait and using `tapir` and `OpenAPIDocsInterpreter`, the documentation can be kept up-to-date with minimal effort. For example, if a new endpoint is added to `WalletEndpoints`, it will automatically be included in the generated documentation.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   This code defines a trait called `WalletDocumentation` that extends `WalletEndpoints` and `OpenAPIDocsInterpreter`, and provides a list of wallet-related endpoints and an OpenAPI specification for the Alephium Wallet.

2. What licensing terms apply to this code?
   This code is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3 or later.

3. What other libraries or dependencies does this code rely on?
   This code relies on the `sttp.apispec.openapi.OpenAPI` and `sttp.tapir` libraries for generating OpenAPI documentation and defining HTTP endpoints.
