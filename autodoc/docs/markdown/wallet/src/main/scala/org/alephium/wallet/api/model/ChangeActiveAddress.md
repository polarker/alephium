The code above defines a case class called `ChangeActiveAddress` which is used in the `org.alephium.wallet.api.model` package of the Alephium project. The purpose of this class is to represent a request to change the active address for a particular asset. 

The `ChangeActiveAddress` class takes a single parameter, an `Address.Asset` object, which represents the new active address for the asset. This object is defined in the `org.alephium.protocol.model` package of the Alephium project and contains information about the address, such as the public key and the network it belongs to.

This class is marked as `final`, which means that it cannot be extended or subclassed. This is likely because the class is intended to be used as a simple data container and should not have any additional functionality added to it.

This class is likely used in the larger Alephium project as part of the wallet functionality. When a user wants to change the active address for a particular asset, they would make a request to the wallet API with the new address information. The API would then create a new `ChangeActiveAddress` object with the new address information and use it to update the active address for the asset.

Here is an example of how this class might be used in the context of the Alephium wallet API:

```
import org.alephium.wallet.api.model.ChangeActiveAddress
import org.alephium.protocol.model.Address

val newAddress = Address.Asset("publicKey", "network")
val changeRequest = ChangeActiveAddress(newAddress)

// send changeRequest to wallet API to update active address for asset
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ChangeActiveAddress` case class?
   - The `ChangeActiveAddress` case class is used to represent a request to change the active address for a specific asset.
2. What is the significance of the `Address.Asset` type in the `ChangeActiveAddress` case class?
   - The `Address.Asset` type indicates that the address being changed is specific to a particular asset.
3. What is the expected behavior if an invalid address is provided to the `ChangeActiveAddress` case class?
   - The code does not specify the behavior if an invalid address is provided, so it is up to the implementation to handle this case appropriately.
