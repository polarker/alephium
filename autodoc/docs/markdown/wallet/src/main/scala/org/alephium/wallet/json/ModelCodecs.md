This file contains code for the Alephium wallet's JSON model codecs. These codecs are used to serialize and deserialize JSON data to and from Scala case classes. The purpose of this code is to define the implicit ReadWriter (RW) instances for various case classes used in the Alephium wallet API. 

The code imports several other libraries and modules, including `ApiModelCodec`, `UtilJson`, `Mnemonic`, and `GroupConfig`. It also defines several case classes, such as `Addresses`, `AddressInfo`, `Balances`, `Transfer`, `Sign`, `Sweep`, `WalletUnlock`, `WalletDeletion`, `WalletRestore`, `WalletCreation`, `WalletStatus`, `RevealMnemonic`, and their corresponding RW instances. 

For example, the `Addresses` case class represents a list of addresses associated with a wallet, and its RW instance is defined using the `macroRW` macro. Similarly, the `Mnemonic` case class represents a BIP39 mnemonic phrase, and its RW instance is defined using the `readwriter` method. 

These codecs are used throughout the Alephium wallet API to convert JSON data to and from Scala case classes. For example, when a user sends a request to the wallet API to create a new wallet, the request data is received as JSON and is deserialized using these codecs to create a corresponding Scala case class instance. The wallet API then processes the request and returns a response, which is serialized back to JSON using these codecs before being sent back to the user. 

Overall, this file plays an important role in the Alephium wallet API by providing the necessary tools to convert JSON data to and from Scala case classes, which enables seamless communication between the wallet API and its users.
