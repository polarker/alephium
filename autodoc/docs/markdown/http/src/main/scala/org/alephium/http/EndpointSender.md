The `EndpointSender` class is a part of the Alephium project and is used to send HTTP requests to endpoints. It extends the `BaseEndpoint` class and uses the `SttpClientInterpreter` trait to create requests. The class takes an optional `ApiKey` parameter and an `ExecutionContext` parameter in its constructor.

The `createRequest` method takes an endpoint, its parameters, and a URI, and returns a request object. The `send` method takes an endpoint, its parameters, and a URI, and returns a future that resolves to the response of the request. The `handleDecodeFailures` method is used to handle decoding errors that may occur when decoding the response of the request.

The `EndpointSender` class uses the `AsyncHttpClientFutureBackend` to send requests asynchronously. The `startSelfOnce` and `stopSelfOnce` methods are used to start and stop the backend, respectively. The `subServices` method returns an empty `ArraySeq`.

Overall, the `EndpointSender` class provides a convenient way to send HTTP requests to endpoints in the Alephium project. Here is an example of how to use it:

```scala
import org.alephium.http.EndpointSender
import org.alephium.api.model.ApiKey
import org.alephium.api.endpoint.MyEndpoint

import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global

val apiKey = ApiKey("my-api-key")
val endpointSender = new EndpointSender(Some(apiKey))

val params = MyEndpoint.Params("param1", "param2")
val uri = uri"https://example.com/my-endpoint"

val response = endpointSender.send(MyEndpoint, params, uri)
```
