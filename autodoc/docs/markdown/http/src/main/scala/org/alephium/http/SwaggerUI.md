The `SwaggerUI` object is a utility for serving a Swagger UI for a given OpenAPI specification. It provides a set of server endpoints that can be used to serve the Swagger UI and the OpenAPI specification file. 

The `apply` method is the main entry point of the object. It takes an OpenAPI specification file as a string, a context path, and a file name for the OpenAPI specification file. It returns a vector of server endpoints that can be used to serve the Swagger UI and the OpenAPI specification file.

The `swaggerVersion` value is the version of the Swagger UI that is used by the utility. It is extracted from the `pom.properties` file of the `swagger-ui` WebJar.

The `openapiEndpoint` server endpoint serves the OpenAPI specification file. It takes no input and returns the OpenAPI specification file as a string.

The `swaggerInitializerJsEndpoint` server endpoint serves the JavaScript file that initializes the Swagger UI. It takes no input and returns the JavaScript file as a string.

The `resourcesEndpoint` server endpoint serves the static resources required by the Swagger UI. It takes no input and returns the static resources as files.

The `redirectToSlashEndpoint` server endpoint redirects requests to the context path without a trailing slash to the context path with a trailing slash. It takes query parameters as input and returns a redirect response.

The `SwaggerUI` object is used in the larger project to serve the Swagger UI and the OpenAPI specification file. It provides a convenient way to serve the Swagger UI without having to write boilerplate code. The server endpoints provided by the `SwaggerUI` object can be used with any HTTP server that supports the Tapir library. 

Example usage:

```scala
import org.alephium.http.SwaggerUI

val openapiContent = "openapi: 3.0.0\ninfo:\n  title: Example API\n  version: 1.0.0\npaths: {}"
val serverEndpoints = SwaggerUI(openapiContent)

// Use the server endpoints with an HTTP server
```

- This code defines an object called `SwaggerUI` that provides a set of server endpoints for serving Swagger UI documentation for an API.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code uses the `sttp` and `tapir` libraries for defining server endpoints and handling HTTP requests and responses.

3. What is the significance of the `GNU Lesser General Public License` mentioned in the comments?
