[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/alephium/alephium/blob/master/flow/src/main/scala/org/alephium/flow/network/broker/OutboundBrokerHandler.scala)

The code defines a trait `OutboundBrokerHandler` that extends `BrokerHandler` and provides functionality for handling outbound broker connections in the Alephium project. The purpose of this code is to establish a connection with a remote broker and perform a handshake to exchange information about the broker's identity and capabilities.

The `OutboundBrokerHandler` trait defines a `connectionType` field that specifies the type of connection as outbound. It also requires implementations to provide a `selfCliqueInfo` field of type `CliqueInfo`, which contains information about the local broker's identity and capabilities. Additionally, it requires an implicit `networkSetting` field of type `NetworkSetting`, which contains network-related configuration settings for the project. Finally, it requires an `cliqueManager` field of type `ActorRefT[CliqueManager.Command]`, which is an actor reference used for managing the clique of brokers in the network.

The `OutboundBrokerHandler` trait defines a `preStart` method that is called when the actor is started. This method publishes an event to connect to the remote broker using the `TcpController.ConnectTo` method. The `OutboundBrokerHandler` trait also defines a `receive` method that initially delegates to the `connecting` method.

The `connecting` method defines a `receive` method that handles messages related to establishing a connection with the remote broker. It uses a `backoffStrategy` to retry connecting to the remote broker if the connection fails. If the connection is successful, it creates a `connection` field of type `ActorRefT[Tcp.Command]` and a `brokerConnectionHandler` field of type `ActorRefT[ConnectionHandler.Command]`. It then becomes the `handShaking` state.

The `handShaking` state is defined in the `BrokerHandler` trait and handles the handshake process with the remote broker. It sends a `Hello` message containing the local broker's identity and capabilities to the remote broker. It also sends periodic `Ping` messages to the remote broker to ensure that the connection is still alive.

Overall, this code provides the functionality for establishing an outbound broker connection and performing a handshake with the remote broker. It is used in the larger Alephium project to enable communication between brokers in the network. An example of using this code would be to create a class that extends `OutboundBrokerHandler` and provides implementations for the required fields. This class can then be used to establish a connection with a remote broker and exchange information about the brokers' identities and capabilities.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what project is it a part of?
- This code is part of the alephium project and it defines the OutboundBrokerHandler trait which is used to handle outbound broker connections.

2. What other files or libraries does this code import and use?
- This code imports and uses several other files and libraries including akka.io.Tcp, org.alephium.flow.network, org.alephium.flow.setting.NetworkSetting, org.alephium.protocol.message.Hello, org.alephium.protocol.model.CliqueInfo, and org.alephium.util.

3. What is the purpose of the Retry case object and how is it used?
- The Retry case object is used to retry connecting to a remote address if the initial connection attempt fails. It is used in the connecting case of the receive method to schedule a new connection attempt after a certain duration.
