This file contains code for a PendingTxStorage trait and a PendingTxRocksDBStorage class that implements it. The purpose of this code is to provide a way to store and manage pending transactions in the Alephium project. 

The PendingTxStorage trait extends the KeyValueStorage trait and defines additional methods for iterating over the stored transactions and replacing them. It also provides a default implementation for getting the size of the storage. The TransactionTemplate class is used to represent a transaction.

The PendingTxRocksDBStorage class is a concrete implementation of the PendingTxStorage trait that uses RocksDB as the underlying storage engine. It extends the RocksDBKeyValueStorage class, which provides a basic implementation of the KeyValueStorage trait using RocksDB. The class overrides the replace method to ensure that the old and new transaction IDs are the same before replacing the transaction.

The code also includes licensing information and imports necessary classes from other parts of the Alephium project.

This code can be used to store and manage pending transactions in the Alephium project. For example, it could be used by a node to keep track of transactions that have been received but not yet included in a block. The PendingTxRocksDBStorage class provides a way to store these transactions in a persistent and efficient manner using RocksDB. The PendingTxStorage trait provides a common interface for working with pending transactions, which could be useful for other parts of the project that need to interact with them.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `PendingTxStorage` trait and what methods does it provide?
   - The `PendingTxStorage` trait is a key-value storage interface for `PersistedTxId` and `TransactionTemplate` objects, and it provides methods for iterating over and replacing these objects.
2. What is the `PendingTxRocksDBStorage` class and how does it relate to the `PendingTxStorage` trait?
   - The `PendingTxRocksDBStorage` class is a concrete implementation of the `PendingTxStorage` trait that uses RocksDB as the underlying storage engine. It provides additional methods for creating and initializing instances of itself.
3. What is the purpose of the `replace` method in `PendingTxRocksDBStorage` and what does it do?
   - The `replace` method in `PendingTxRocksDBStorage` replaces an existing `PersistedTxId` with a new one, while also updating the associated `TransactionTemplate`. It first removes the old object and then puts the new one in its place.
