This file defines two constants in the `org.alephium.flow.core` package object: `maxForkDepth` and `maxSyncBlocksPerChain`. 

`maxForkDepth` is an integer value that represents the maximum depth of a fork in the blockchain. A fork occurs when two or more blocks are created at the same height in the blockchain. When this happens, the network must choose which block to accept as the valid one. If the fork depth exceeds the maximum value defined in this file, the network will reject the fork and the blockchain will not continue to grow in that direction.

`maxSyncBlocksPerChain` is also an integer value that represents the maximum number of blocks that can be synchronized between nodes in a single chain. When a new node joins the network, it must synchronize its blockchain with the rest of the network. If the number of blocks to be synchronized exceeds the maximum value defined in this file, the synchronization process will be aborted and the node will not be able to join the network.

These constants are used throughout the Alephium project to ensure the stability and security of the blockchain network. For example, the `maxForkDepth` value is used in the consensus algorithm to prevent malicious actors from creating deep forks in the blockchain. The `maxSyncBlocksPerChain` value is used in the network protocol to limit the amount of data that must be transferred between nodes during synchronization.

Here is an example of how these constants might be used in the Alephium codebase:

```
import org.alephium.flow.core._

if (forkDepth > maxForkDepth) {
  // reject the fork
}

if (numSyncBlocks > maxSyncBlocksPerChain) {
  // abort synchronization
}
```

Overall, this file plays an important role in ensuring the stability and security of the Alephium blockchain network by defining limits on the depth of forks and the number of blocks that can be synchronized between nodes.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file contains licensing information and defines two constants for the `org.alephium.flow.core` package.

2. What is the significance of the `maxForkDepth` constant?
- The `maxForkDepth` constant has a value of 100 and is likely used to limit the depth of forks in the Alephium blockchain.

3. What is the significance of the `maxSyncBlocksPerChain` constant?
- The `maxSyncBlocksPerChain` constant has a value of 50 and is likely used to limit the number of blocks that can be synced per chain in the Alephium blockchain.
