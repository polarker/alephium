The `SelectionHandler` object and class are part of the `alephium` project and are used to handle UDP network selection. The purpose of this code is to provide a way to handle UDP network selection in a non-blocking way. 

The `SelectionHandler` object is an extension of the Akka actor system and is used to create instances of the `SelectionHandler` class. The `createExtension` method creates a new instance of the `SelectionHandler` class and registers a selector with the system. The selector is used to monitor the readiness of channels for I/O operations. 

The `SelectionHandler` class is responsible for handling the selection of UDP network channels. It contains a selector, a timeout, and a list of pending tasks. The `registerTask` method is used to add a new task to the list of pending tasks. The `select` method is used to select channels that are ready for I/O operations. The `loop` method is used to execute the `select` method in a loop. 

When a channel is selected, the `key` object is retrieved from the `selectedKeys` set. The `udpServer` object is retrieved from the `attachment` of the `key` object. The `readyOps` variable is used to determine which I/O operations are ready to be performed. If the `OP_READ` operation is ready, the `udpServer` object is sent a `Read` message. 

Overall, the `SelectionHandler` object and class provide a way to handle UDP network selection in a non-blocking way. This code is used in the larger `alephium` project to handle UDP network communication. 

Example usage:

```
val selectionHandler = SelectionHandler(system)
selectionHandler.registerTask(() => println("Task executed"))
selectionHandler.select()
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    
    This code is a modified version of akka.io.SelectionHandler and is used to handle selection of UDP sockets for the Alephium project.

2. What is the license for this code?
    
    This code is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License version 3 or later.

3. What is the purpose of the `registerTask` method?
    
    The `registerTask` method is used to add a new task to the list of pending tasks that will be executed during the next call to `select`.
