This file contains the implementation of the `OutboundBrokerHandler` class, which is responsible for handling outbound connections to other brokers in the Alephium network. 

The `OutboundBrokerHandler` class extends the `BaseOutboundBrokerHandler` class and implements the `BrokerHandler` trait. It takes in several parameters, including the `selfCliqueInfo` of the local node, the `remoteAddress` of the remote broker, the `blockflow` instance, the `allHandlers` instance, the `cliqueManager` actor reference, and the `blockFlowSynchronizer` actor reference. These parameters are used to initialize the class and provide it with the necessary information to handle outbound connections.

The `OutboundBrokerHandler` class also defines a `props` method that takes in the same parameters as the constructor and returns a `Props` instance that can be used to create a new instance of the class. This method is used by the `BrokerHandlerManager` to create new instances of the `OutboundBrokerHandler` class as needed.

Overall, the `OutboundBrokerHandler` class plays an important role in the Alephium network by facilitating outbound connections to other brokers. It is used in conjunction with other classes and actors to manage the flow of blocks and transactions across the network. Below is an example of how the `OutboundBrokerHandler` class might be used in the larger project:

```scala
val outboundBrokerHandler = system.actorOf(
  OutboundBrokerHandler.props(
    selfCliqueInfo,
    remoteBroker,
    blockflow,
    allHandlers,
    cliqueManager,
    blockFlowSynchronizer
  )
)
```

In this example, a new instance of the `OutboundBrokerHandler` class is created using the `props` method and passed several parameters, including the `selfCliqueInfo` of the local node and the `remoteBroker` information for the remote broker. This instance can then be used to manage outbound connections to the remote broker and facilitate the flow of blocks and transactions across the network.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file contains the implementation of an outbound broker handler for the Alephium project's intraclique network.

2. What other files or modules does this code file depend on?
- This code file depends on several other modules and files, including `BlockFlow`, `AllHandlers`, `CliqueManager`, `BlockFlowSynchronizer`, `BrokerConfig`, `NetworkSetting`, and `BrokerHandler`.

3. What is the role of the `OutboundBrokerHandler` class in the Alephium project's intraclique network?
- The `OutboundBrokerHandler` class is responsible for handling outbound broker connections in the Alephium project's intraclique network, and it extends the `BaseOutboundBrokerHandler` class and implements the `BrokerHandler` trait.
