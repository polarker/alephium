This file contains the implementation of the `BlockChain` trait, which defines the behavior of a blockchain data structure. The `BlockChain` trait extends the `BlockPool`, `BlockHeaderChain`, and `BlockHashChain` traits, which provide additional functionality for managing blocks and their headers.

The `BlockChain` trait defines several methods for interacting with the blockchain data structure. The `validateBlockHeight` method checks whether a given block can be added to the blockchain based on its height and the maximum fork depth. The `getBlock` and `getBlockUnsafe` methods retrieve a block from the blockchain by its hash. The `getMainChainBlockByHeight` method retrieves the main chain block at a given height. The `getHeightedBlocks` method retrieves all blocks within a given timestamp range. The `add` method adds a block to the blockchain, and the `addGenesis` method adds the genesis block to the blockchain.

The `BlockChain` trait also defines several methods for managing transactions. The `getTransaction` method retrieves a transaction from the blockchain by its ID. The `isTxConfirmed` method checks whether a transaction has been confirmed by the blockchain. The `getTxStatus` method retrieves the status of a transaction, including its index and number of confirmations.

Overall, the `BlockChain` trait provides a high-level interface for managing a blockchain data structure. It can be used as a building block for implementing more complex blockchain applications.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `BlockChain` trait and what methods does it provide?
- The `BlockChain` trait provides methods for managing and validating blocks and transactions in a blockchain, including adding blocks, retrieving blocks and transactions, and calculating block diffs. It extends several other traits and classes to provide this functionality.

2. What is the purpose of the `validateBlockHeight` method and how does it work?
- The `validateBlockHeight` method checks whether a given block can be added to the blockchain based on its height and the maximum fork depth allowed. It retrieves the height of the parent block and adds 1 to get the height of the new block. It then checks whether the sum of the new block's height and the maximum fork depth is greater than or equal to the current maximum height of the blockchain.

3. What is the purpose of the `getTxStatus` method and how does it work?
- The `getTxStatus` method retrieves the confirmation status of a transaction by calculating the number of confirmations it has in the blockchain. It first retrieves the canonical index of the transaction, which is the index of the transaction in the block that is considered the canonical block for that transaction. It then calculates the number of confirmations by subtracting the height of the block containing the transaction from the current maximum height of the blockchain and adding 1. It returns an `Option[TxStatus]` object containing the canonical index and number of confirmations, or `None` if the transaction is not found in the blockchain.
