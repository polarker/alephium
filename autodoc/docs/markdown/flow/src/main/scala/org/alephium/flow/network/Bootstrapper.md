The `Bootstrapper` file is part of the Alephium project and contains the implementation of the `Bootstrapper` class and its related classes and methods. The purpose of this file is to provide a way for nodes to bootstrap into the Alephium network. 

The `Bootstrapper` class is an Akka actor that is responsible for managing the bootstrap process. It receives connections from other nodes and forwards them to the appropriate `CliqueManager` actor. The `CliqueManager` actor is responsible for managing the clique that the node belongs to. 

The `Bootstrapper` class has three subclasses: `SingleNodeCliqueBootstrapper`, `CliqueCoordinatorBootstrapper`, and `BrokerBootstrapper`. The `SingleNodeCliqueBootstrapper` is used when the node is the only node in the clique. The `CliqueCoordinatorBootstrapper` is used when the node is the coordinator of the clique. The `BrokerBootstrapper` is used when the node is a broker in the clique. 

The `Bootstrapper` class has several methods that are used to manage the bootstrap process. The `loadOrGenDiscoveryKey` method is used to load or generate the discovery key for the node. The discovery key is used to identify the node to other nodes in the network. The `persistBootstrapInfo` method is used to persist the bootstrap information for the node. The bootstrap information includes the discovery key and the timestamp of when the node was bootstrapped. 

The `Bootstrapper` class also has several message types that are used to communicate with other actors in the network. The `ForwardConnection` message is used to forward a connection to the appropriate `CliqueManager` actor. The `GetIntraCliqueInfo` message is used to retrieve the intra-clique information for the node. The `SendIntraCliqueInfo` message is used to send the intra-clique information to the `Bootstrapper` actor. 

Overall, the `Bootstrapper` file is an important part of the Alephium project as it provides a way for nodes to bootstrap into the network. The `Bootstrapper` class manages the bootstrap process and forwards connections to the appropriate `CliqueManager` actor. The `Bootstrapper` class also has several methods and message types that are used to manage the bootstrap process.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Bootstrapper` class and its related classes?
- The `Bootstrapper` class and its related classes are responsible for bootstrapping the network and coordinating the connection between nodes in the Alephium network.

2. What is the role of the `CliqueCoordinatorBootstrapper` class?
- The `CliqueCoordinatorBootstrapper` class is responsible for starting the `CliqueCoordinator` actor and forwarding incoming connections to it. It also loads or generates a discovery key for the node.

3. What is the purpose of the `IntraCliqueInfo` class?
- The `IntraCliqueInfo` class represents information about a clique, including the clique ID, a vector of peer information, the number of groups per broker, and the discovery private key. It is used to bootstrap the network and coordinate connections between nodes.
