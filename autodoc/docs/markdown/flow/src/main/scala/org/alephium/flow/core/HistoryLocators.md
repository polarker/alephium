The code provided is a Scala file named "HistoryLocators" that is part of the Alephium project. The purpose of this file is to provide a method for sampling heights within a specified range. The method is called "sampleHeights" and takes two parameters: "fromHeight" and "toHeight". These parameters represent the inclusive range of heights to sample.

The method first checks that the "fromHeight" parameter is less than or equal to the "toHeight" parameter and that "fromHeight" is greater than or equal to zero. If these conditions are not met, an exception will be thrown.

Next, the method initializes a mutable array buffer called "heights" with the value of "toHeight". It then initializes two variables: "shift" with a value of 1 and "height" with a value of "toHeight" minus "shift". The method then enters a while loop that continues as long as "height" is greater than or equal to "fromHeight". Within the loop, the current value of "height" is added to the "heights" array buffer, and "shift" is multiplied by 2. The value of "height" is then updated to "toHeight" minus "shift". Once the loop has completed, the "heights" array buffer is converted to an immutable vector using the "AVector.from" method and then reversed to ensure that the heights are in ascending order.

This method can be used in the larger Alephium project to sample heights within a specified range for various purposes, such as retrieving block data or validating transactions. An example of how this method could be used is as follows:

```
val fromHeight = 100
val toHeight = 200
val sampledHeights = HistoryLocators.sampleHeights(fromHeight, toHeight)
// sampledHeights will contain an immutable vector of heights from 100 to 200, sampled at logarithmic intervals
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `HistoryLocators` object?
- The `HistoryLocators` object provides a method `sampleHeights` that returns a vector of heights within a given range.

2. What is the input format for the `sampleHeights` method?
- The `sampleHeights` method takes two integer parameters `fromHeight` and `toHeight`, which represent the inclusive range of heights to sample.

3. What is the algorithm used in the `sampleHeights` method to generate the vector of heights?
- The `sampleHeights` method uses a loop to generate a sequence of heights by subtracting a power of 2 from the `toHeight` parameter until the resulting height is greater than or equal to the `fromHeight` parameter. The resulting sequence is then reversed and returned as an `AVector`.
