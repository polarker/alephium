The `KeyedFlow` class is an indexed data structure for network flow. It is used to manage a collection of nodes that represent a network flow graph. Each node in the graph is identified by a unique key of type `K`. The `KeyedFlow` class provides methods to add, remove, and query nodes in the graph.

The `KeyedFlow` class has two type parameters: `K` and `N`. `K` is the type of the node keys, and `N` is the type of the nodes in the graph. `N` must be a subtype of the `Node` trait, which defines the interface for nodes in the graph.

The `KeyedFlow` class has two constructors. The first constructor takes two arguments: a vector of maps that group source nodes by their key, and a map that contains all nodes in the graph. The second constructor takes only a map of nodes, and creates an empty vector of source node groups.

The `KeyedFlow` class provides methods to query the size of the graph, check if a node with a given key exists in the graph, get a node with a given key, and get a vector of source nodes from a specific group. The `takeSourceNodes` method takes a type parameter `T` and a function `f` that maps nodes to `T`. It returns a vector of up to `maxNum` nodes from the specified source node group, mapped by `f`.

The `KeyedFlow` class provides methods to add and remove nodes from the graph. The `addNewNode` method adds a new node to the graph. If the node has parents, it adds the node as a child to each parent. If the node has children, it adds the node as a parent to each child. If the node has no parents, it adds the node to the source node group. The `removeNodeAndAncestors` method removes a node and all its ancestors from the graph. The `removeNodeAndDescendants` method removes a node and all its descendants from the graph.

The `KeyedFlow` class is used in the larger project to manage the flow of transactions in the Alephium network. Each transaction is represented by a node in the graph, and the edges between nodes represent the dependencies between transactions. The `KeyedFlow` class is used to add new transactions to the graph, remove transactions from the graph, and query the graph for source nodes to process.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `KeyedFlow` class?
- The `KeyedFlow` class is an indexed data structure for network flow.

2. What is the `Node` trait and what methods does it define?
- The `Node` trait is a trait that defines methods for adding and removing parents and children, as well as methods for checking if a node is a source or sink. It also defines the `key` and `getGroup` methods.

3. What is the purpose of the `addToBuffer` and `removeFromBuffer` methods?
- The `addToBuffer` and `removeFromBuffer` methods are helper methods for adding and removing nodes from mutable arrays. They take in a getter and setter for the array, and modify the array accordingly.
