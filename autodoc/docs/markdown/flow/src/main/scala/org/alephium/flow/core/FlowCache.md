The `FlowCache` class and its companion object in the `org.alephium.flow.core` package provide a generic implementation of a cache that stores key-value pairs in a `ValueSortedMap`. The cache is designed to have a maximum capacity, and when the number of stored elements exceeds this capacity, the least recently used element is evicted from the cache.

The `FlowCache` class is parameterized by two types, `K` and `V`, which represent the types of the keys and values stored in the cache, respectively. The class has a single constructor that takes a `ValueSortedMap` and a capacity as arguments. The `underlying` field stores the `ValueSortedMap` instance, and the `capacity` field stores the maximum number of elements that the cache can hold.

The `FlowCache` class provides several methods for accessing and modifying the cache. The `size` method returns the number of elements currently stored in the cache. The `exists` method takes a `BlockHash` key and returns `true` if the key is present in the cache, and `false` otherwise. The `existsE` method is similar to `exists`, but it takes a by-name parameter `genExists` that generates a result of type `Either[E, Boolean]`. If the key is present in the cache, `existsE` returns `Right(true)`. Otherwise, it calls `genExists` to generate the result. If `genExists` returns `Right(false)`, `existsE` returns `Right(false)`. Otherwise, it returns the `Left` value generated by `genExists`. The `existsUnsafe` method is similar to `existsE`, but it takes a by-name parameter `genExists` that generates a `Boolean` result. If the key is present in the cache, `existsUnsafe` returns `true`. Otherwise, it calls `genExists` to generate the result. If `genExists` returns `false`, `existsUnsafe` returns `false`. Otherwise, it returns `true`.

The `get` method takes a `BlockHash` key and returns an `Option[V]` that contains the value associated with the key if it is present in the cache, or `None` otherwise. The `getE` method is similar to `get`, but it takes a by-name parameter `genValue` that generates a result of type `Either[E, V]`. If the key is present in the cache, `getE` returns `Right(value)`, where `value` is the value associated with the key. Otherwise, it calls `genValue` to generate the result. If `genValue` returns `Right(value)`, `getE` returns `Right(value)`. Otherwise, it returns the `Left` value generated by `genValue`. The `getUnsafe` method is similar to `getE`, but it takes a by-name parameter `genValue` that generates a `V` result. If the key is present in the cache, `getUnsafe` returns the value associated with the key. Otherwise, it calls `genValue` to generate the result.

The `put` method takes a `BlockHash` key and a value of type `V`, and stores the key-value pair in the cache. If the cache already contains the key, the existing value is replaced with the new value. After storing the new key-value pair, the `evict` method is called to ensure that the number of stored elements does not exceed the cache capacity. The `evict` method removes the least recently used element from the cache if the number of stored elements exceeds the capacity.

The `FlowCache` companion object provides three factory methods for creating instances of `FlowCache` with different types of values. The `blocks` method creates a cache that stores `BlockCache` values, which represent the state of a block in the blockchain. The `headers` method creates a cache that stores `BlockHeader` values, which represent the header of a block in the blockchain. The `states` method creates a cache that stores `BlockState` values, which represent the state of the blockchain at a particular height. Each factory method takes a capacity as an argument, which is used to set the maximum number of elements that the cache can hold. The `blocks` method also takes an implicit `BrokerConfig` argument, which is used to calculate the capacity based on the number of groups in the blockchain. The `Ordering` type class is used to define the ordering of the keys and values stored in the cache. The `hashOrdering` implicit value defines the ordering of `BlockHash` keys based on their byte representation. The `blockOrdering` implicit value defines the ordering of `BlockCache` values based on their `blockTime` field. The `headerOrdering` implicit value defines the ordering of `BlockHeader` values based on their `timestamp` field. The `stateOrdering` implicit value defines the ordering of `BlockState` values based on their `height` field.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `FlowCache` class and how is it used in the `alephium` project?
- The `FlowCache` class is a generic cache implementation that uses a `ValueSortedMap` to store key-value pairs. It is used in the `alephium` project to cache block data such as headers, states, and caches. 

2. What is the purpose of the `blocks`, `headers`, and `states` methods in the `FlowCache` object?
- The `blocks`, `headers`, and `states` methods are factory methods that create instances of `FlowCache` with specific key-value types and capacities. They are used to create caches for block data in the `alephium` project.

3. How does the `evict` method work in the `FlowCache` class?
- The `evict` method removes the oldest key-value pair from the cache if the cache size exceeds its capacity. It does this by removing the key-value pair with the smallest key (i.e. the oldest block data).
