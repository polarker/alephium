This file contains a sealed trait called `ConnectionType` and two case objects `InboundConnection` and `OutboundConnection` that extend the `ConnectionType` trait. 

The purpose of this code is to define the two types of connections that can be established in the `org.alephium.flow.network.broker` package of the Alephium project. The `InboundConnection` case object represents a connection that is initiated by an external node to the current node, while the `OutboundConnection` case object represents a connection that is initiated by the current node to an external node. 

This code can be used in the larger project to differentiate between inbound and outbound connections and to handle them accordingly. For example, when a new connection is established, the type of connection can be determined using the `ConnectionType` trait and appropriate actions can be taken based on the type of connection. 

Here is an example of how this code can be used in the larger project:

```
import org.alephium.flow.network.broker._

// Function to handle a new connection
def handleConnection(connectionType: ConnectionType): Unit = {
  connectionType match {
    case InboundConnection => println("New inbound connection established")
    case OutboundConnection => println("New outbound connection established")
  }
}

// Example usage
val newConnectionType = InboundConnection
handleConnection(newConnectionType) // Output: "New inbound connection established"
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ConnectionType` trait and its two case objects?
- The `ConnectionType` trait is used to represent the type of connection in the `broker` network module of the Alephium project. The two case objects `InboundConnection` and `OutboundConnection` represent incoming and outgoing connections respectively.

2. What license is this code released under?
- This code is released under the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3 or later.

3. What is the significance of the `org.alephium.flow.network.broker` package?
- The `org.alephium.flow.network.broker` package is where the `ConnectionType` trait and its case objects are defined. It is likely that this package contains other classes and objects related to the `broker` network module of the Alephium project.
