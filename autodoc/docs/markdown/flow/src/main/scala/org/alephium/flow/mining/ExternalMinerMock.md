The `ExternalMinerMock` file is part of the Alephium project and contains the implementation of a mock miner that connects to the Alephium network and performs mining tasks. The purpose of this code is to simulate the behavior of a real miner and test the mining functionality of the network.

The `ExternalMinerMock` object contains several methods that create instances of the `ExternalMinerMock` class. The `singleNode` method creates a mock miner that connects to a single node in the network. The `props` method creates a mock miner that connects to multiple nodes in the network. The `connection` method creates a connection handler for a given remote address.

The `ExternalMinerMock` class extends the `Miner` trait, which defines the behavior of a miner in the Alephium network. The `ExternalMinerMock` class overrides the `receive` method to handle mining tasks and network connections. The `apiConnections` field is an array of optional connection handlers that represent the connections to the miner API of each node in the network.

The `handleConnection` method handles network connections. It listens for incoming connections and attempts to reconnect if a connection is lost. The `subscribeForTasks` method subscribes the miner to receive mining tasks from the network. The `unsubscribeTasks` method unsubscribes the miner from receiving mining tasks. The `publishNewBlock` method publishes a new block to the network.

The `handleMiningTasks` method handles incoming mining tasks. It receives a `ServerMessage` object and calls the `handleServerMessage` method to process the message. The `handleServerMessage` method processes the message and updates the state of the miner accordingly.

In summary, the `ExternalMinerMock` file contains the implementation of a mock miner that connects to the Alephium network and performs mining tasks. It provides methods to create instances of the mock miner and handle network connections and mining tasks. This code is used to test the mining functionality of the Alephium network.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ExternalMinerMock` class?
- The `ExternalMinerMock` class is a mock implementation of a miner that connects to a real miner API and receives mining tasks to solve.

2. What is the purpose of the `handleServerMessage` method?
- The `handleServerMessage` method is responsible for handling messages received from the miner API, such as new mining tasks and submit results.

3. What is the purpose of the `backoffStrategies` variable?
- The `backoffStrategies` variable is a mutable HashMap that stores the backoff strategies for each miner API connection. It is used to retry connecting to a miner API in case of a failure.
