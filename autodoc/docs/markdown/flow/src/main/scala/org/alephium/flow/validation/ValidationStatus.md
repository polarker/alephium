[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/alephium/alephium/blob/master/flow/src/main/scala/org/alephium/flow/validation/ValidationStatus.scala)

This file contains code related to validation of various components of the Alephium blockchain. The code defines several sealed traits and case objects that represent different types of invalid status that can be encountered during validation. These include InvalidBlockStatus, InvalidHeaderStatus, and InvalidTxStatus. 

The code also defines several functions that are used to return validation results. For example, the function invalidHeader returns a HeaderValidationResult with a Left value that contains a Right value representing the specific InvalidHeaderStatus encountered during validation. Similarly, the function invalidBlock returns a BlockValidationResult with a Left value that contains a Right value representing the specific InvalidBlockStatus encountered during validation. 

The code also includes several case classes that represent specific types of invalid status. For example, the case class MissingDeps represents the case where a block header is missing dependencies. The case class ExistInvalidTx represents the case where a block contains an invalid transaction. 

Overall, this code is an important part of the Alephium blockchain as it provides the functionality to validate various components of the blockchain. This validation is crucial to ensure the integrity and security of the blockchain. The functions and case classes defined in this file can be used throughout the Alephium project to validate blocks, headers, and transactions. 

Example usage of the functions defined in this file:
```
val header: Header = ???
val validationResult: HeaderValidationResult[Header] = 
  if (header.version != 1) {
    ValidationStatus.invalidHeader(InvalidBlockVersion)
  } else {
    ValidationStatus.validHeader(header)
  }
```
