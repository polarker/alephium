This file defines two case classes, `Normal` and `Reorg`, which are used to represent changes to a mempool in the Alephium project. 

A mempool is a data structure used by nodes in a blockchain network to store unconfirmed transactions. When a transaction is broadcast to the network, it is first added to the mempool of each node it reaches. Miners then select transactions from the mempool to include in the next block they mine. 

The `Normal` case class represents a normal update to the mempool, where a set of transactions are removed from the mempool. It contains a single field, `toRemove`, which is an `AVector` (a vector with efficient append and prepend operations) of pairs of `ChainIndex` and `Transaction` vectors. The `ChainIndex` represents the chain on which the transactions were added to the mempool, and the `Transaction` vector contains the transactions to be removed. 

The `Reorg` case class represents a reorganization of the blockchain, where a set of transactions are removed from the mempool and a different set of transactions are added. It contains two fields, `toRemove` and `toAdd`, both of which are `AVector` of pairs of `ChainIndex` and `Transaction` vectors. The `toRemove` field represents the transactions to be removed from the mempool, and the `toAdd` field represents the transactions to be added to the mempool. 

These case classes are used in various parts of the Alephium project to represent changes to the mempool. For example, when a new block is received, the transactions it contains may need to be removed from the mempool. This can be represented using a `Normal` update. Similarly, when a reorganization occurs, the transactions that were previously confirmed on the old chain may need to be removed from the mempool, while the transactions that are now confirmed on the new chain may need to be added. This can be represented using a `Reorg` update. 

Here is an example of how these case classes might be used in code:

```scala
val toRemove = AVector((ChainIndex(0), AVector(tx1, tx2)), (ChainIndex(1), AVector(tx3)))
val normalUpdate = Normal(toRemove)

val toRemove = AVector((ChainIndex(0), AVector(tx1, tx2)), (ChainIndex(1), AVector(tx3)))
val toAdd = AVector((ChainIndex(2), AVector(tx4, tx5)))
val reorgUpdate = Reorg(toRemove, toAdd)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   This code defines two case classes, `Normal` and `Reorg`, which extend the `MemPoolChanges` trait. These classes are used to represent changes to a mempool in the Alephium project.

2. What other files or packages does this code interact with?
   This code imports two classes from the `org.alephium.protocol.model` package, `ChainIndex` and `Transaction`, and one class from the `org.alephium.util` package, `AVector`. It is likely that this code interacts with other files or packages within the Alephium project as well.

3. What is the license for this code and where can I find more information about it?
