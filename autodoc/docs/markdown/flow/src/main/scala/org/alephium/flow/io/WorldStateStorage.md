The `WorldStateStorage` trait and the `WorldStateRockDBStorage` class are part of the Alephium project and are used to store and retrieve world state data for the blockchain. 

The `WorldStateStorage` trait defines methods for getting and putting world state data, as well as methods for getting cached and persisted world state data. It also defines three properties: `trieStorage`, `trieImmutableStateStorage`, and `logStorage`, which are used to store trie data, immutable state data, and log data, respectively. 

The `WorldStateRockDBStorage` class extends the `RocksDBKeyValueStorage` class and implements the `WorldStateStorage` trait. It takes in several parameters, including the `trieStorage`, `trieImmutableStateStorage`, and `logStorage` properties defined in the `WorldStateStorage` trait, as well as a `storage` parameter, which is an instance of the `RocksDBSource` class. 

The `WorldStateRockDBStorage` class is used to store world state data in a RocksDB database. It provides methods for getting and putting world state data, as well as methods for getting cached and persisted world state data. It also provides methods for creating a new instance of the `WorldStateRockDBStorage` class. 

Overall, the `WorldStateStorage` trait and the `WorldStateRockDBStorage` class are important components of the Alephium project, as they are used to store and retrieve world state data for the blockchain. Developers can use these classes to interact with the world state data and to build applications on top of the Alephium blockchain. 

Example usage:

```scala
val trieStorage = new KeyValueStorage[Hash, SparseMerkleTrie.Node]()
val trieImmutableStateStorage = new KeyValueStorage[Hash, ContractStorageImmutableState]()
val logStorage = new LogStorage()

val storage = new RocksDBSource()
val cf = new ColumnFamily()
val writeOptions = new WriteOptions()
val readOptions = new ReadOptions()

val worldStateStorage = WorldStateRockDBStorage(
  trieStorage,
  trieImmutableStateStorage,
  logStorage,
  storage,
  cf,
  writeOptions
)

val hash = BlockHash("example-hash")
val worldState = WorldState.Persisted(...)
worldStateStorage.putTrie(hash, worldState)
val persistedWorldState = worldStateStorage.getPersistedWorldState(hash)
```
