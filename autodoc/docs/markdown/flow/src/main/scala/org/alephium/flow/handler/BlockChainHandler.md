The `BlockChainHandler` class is a part of the Alephium project and is responsible for handling blocks in the blockchain. It extends the `ChainHandler` class, which is a generic class for handling data in the blockchain. The `BlockChainHandler` class is specific to blocks and provides additional functionality for handling blocks.

The class defines a set of commands and events that can be used to interact with the handler. The `Validate` command is used to validate a block. The `BlockAdded` event is emitted when a block is successfully added to the blockchain. The `BlockAddingFailed` event is emitted when adding a block to the blockchain fails. The `InvalidBlock` event is emitted when a block is invalid.

The class also defines a set of metrics that can be used to monitor the performance of the handler. The `blocksTotal` metric tracks the total number of blocks in the blockchain. The `blocksReceivedTotal` metric tracks the total number of blocks received by the handler. The `transactionsReceivedTotal` metric tracks the total number of transactions received by the handler.

The `BlockChainHandler` class is used in the larger Alephium project to handle blocks in the blockchain. It provides a way to validate blocks and add them to the blockchain. It also provides a way to monitor the performance of the handler. The class is designed to be extensible and can be customized to handle different types of blocks.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file contains the implementation of the BlockChainHandler class, which is responsible for handling and validating blocks in the Alephium blockchain.

2. What are the different events that can be triggered by this code?
- The different events that can be triggered by this code are BlockAdded, BlockAddingFailed, and InvalidBlock.

3. What are the different metrics that are being measured by this code?
- This code measures the total number of blocks, blocks received, and transactions received, and labels them based on the chain they belong to. It also measures the duration of chain validation and labels it as "Block".
