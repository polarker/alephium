This file contains the implementation of the `BrokerHandler` trait, which is used for intra-clique communication in the Alephium project. The purpose of this code is to handle the exchange of data between brokers within the same clique. 

The `BrokerHandler` trait extends the `BaseBrokerHandler` trait and overrides some of its methods to handle intra-clique communication. It also defines some additional methods to handle syncing and inventory exchange. 

The `BrokerHandler` trait takes in several dependencies, including `BlockFlow`, `FlowHandler`, `TxHandler`, `CliqueManager`, and `IntraCliqueManager`. It also defines a `remoteBrokerInfo` variable to store information about the remote broker it is communicating with. 

The `handleHandshakeInfo` method is called when a handshake message is received from a remote broker. It checks if the remote broker is part of the same clique and sends a `HandShaked` message to the `cliqueManager` if it is. 

The `exchanging` method is called when the broker is in the exchanging state. It defines a `syncing` method that schedules a periodic sync of inventories and handles the exchange of headers and blocks. 

The `handleInv` method is called when a new inventory is received from the remote broker. It extracts the headers and blocks that need to be synced and sends a `HeadersRequest` and `BlocksRequest` message to the remote broker. 

The `handleTxsResponse` method is called when a `TxsResponse` message is received from the remote broker. It adds the received transactions to the mempool using the `TxHandler` and sets the `isIntraCliqueSyncing` flag to true. 

The `extractToSync` method is a helper method that extracts the headers and blocks that need to be synced based on the received inventory. 

Overall, this code provides the functionality for intra-clique communication between brokers in the Alephium project. It handles the exchange of headers, blocks, and transactions and ensures that the data is synced between the brokers in the same clique.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file contains a trait `BrokerHandler` that extends `BaseBrokerHandler` and provides additional functionality for handling intra-clique communication between brokers in the Alephium network.

2. What is the `handleInv` method responsible for?
- The `handleInv` method is responsible for handling a new inventory of block hashes received from an intra-clique broker. It extracts the headers and blocks that need to be synced with the remote broker and sends requests for them.

3. What is the significance of the `IntraSync` case object?
- The `IntraSync` case object is used to schedule periodic syncing of inventories between intra-clique brokers. It is used in the `syncing` method to schedule a periodic sync request to be sent to the remote broker.
