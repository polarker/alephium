The `TxIndexes` class is a data structure that indexes transactions in the mempool of the Alephium project. It provides methods to add, remove, and query transactions in the mempool.

The class contains several mutable hash maps that store the transactions and their relevant information. The `inputIndex` and `outputIndex` hash maps store the transactions by their input and output references, respectively. The `addressIndex` hash map stores the output references by their lockup script. The `outputType` variable specifies the type of output, which is set to `MemPoolOutput`.

The `add` method adds a transaction to the mempool and returns its parent and child transactions. The `addXGroupTx` method adds a transaction to the mempool for cross-group transactions. The `remove` method removes a transaction from the mempool. The `isSpent` method checks if an output reference is spent. The `isDoubleSpending` method checks if a transaction is double-spending. The `getRelevantUtxos` method returns the relevant unspent transaction outputs for a given lockup script. The `clear` method clears the mempool.

The `getParentTxs` and `getChildTxs` methods are helper methods that return the parent and child transactions of a given transaction, respectively.

The `TxIndexes` object provides a factory method `emptyMemPool` that creates an empty mempool for a given main group.

Example usage:

```scala
import org.alephium.flow.mempool.TxIndexes
import org.alephium.protocol.config.GroupConfig
import org.alephium.protocol.model.TransactionTemplate
import org.alephium.protocol.vm.LockupScript

implicit val groupConfig: GroupConfig = ???
val mainGroup: GroupIndex = ???

val txIndexes = TxIndexes.emptyMemPool(mainGroup)

val tx: TransactionTemplate = ???
val lockupScript: LockupScript = ???

val (parents, children) = txIndexes.add(tx, tx => tx)
val relevantUtxos = txIndexes.getRelevantUtxos(lockupScript)
txIndexes.remove(tx)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code defines a class called `TxIndexes` which represents indexes for transactions in a mempool. It provides methods to add and remove transactions, check if an output is spent, get relevant UTXOs, and clear the indexes.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
- This code imports several classes from other packages, including `GroupConfig`, `LockupScript`, and `AVector`. It also uses the `mutable` package from the Scala standard library.

3. What license is this code released under?
- This code is released under the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3 or later.
