This code defines a trait and a class for storing and managing ready transactions in a RocksDB database. The trait `ReadyTxStorage` extends the `KeyValueStorage` trait and defines additional methods for iterating over the stored transactions and clearing the storage. The `ReadyTxRocksDBStorage` class extends the `RocksDBKeyValueStorage` class and implements the `ReadyTxStorage` trait. It also defines a method for clearing the storage by iterating over the stored transactions and removing them one by one.

The `ReadyTxStorage` trait defines the following methods:
- `iterateE`: iterates over the stored transactions and applies a function to each transaction. The function takes a `TransactionId` and a `ReadyTxInfo` object as arguments and returns an `IOResult[Unit]`.
- `iterate`: similar to `iterateE`, but the function applied to each transaction does not return an `IOResult`.
- `clear`: removes all stored transactions from the storage.

The `ReadyTxRocksDBStorage` class defines a constructor that takes a `RocksDBSource` object, a column family, and read and write options as arguments. It also defines the `clear` method, which iterates over the stored transactions and removes them one by one using the `remove` method inherited from `RocksDBKeyValueStorage`.

This code is part of the Alephium project and can be used to store and manage ready transactions in a RocksDB database. The `ReadyTxRocksDBStorage` class can be instantiated with a `RocksDBSource` object and used to store and retrieve transactions using the `put` and `get` methods inherited from `RocksDBKeyValueStorage`. The `iterate` and `iterateE` methods can be used to iterate over the stored transactions and perform operations on them. The `clear` method can be used to remove all stored transactions from the database.
## Questions:
