The `BrokerStorage` trait and `BrokerRocksDBStorage` class define a key-value storage system for broker discovery state information in the Alephium project. The purpose of this code is to provide a way to store and retrieve information about brokers in the Alephium network.

The `BrokerStorage` trait defines two methods: `addBroker` and `activeBrokers`. The `addBroker` method takes a `BrokerInfo` object and adds it to the storage system. The `activeBrokers` method returns a list of all active brokers in the storage system.

The `BrokerRocksDBStorage` class extends the `RocksDBKeyValueStorage` class and implements the `BrokerStorage` trait. It provides an implementation of the `addBroker` and `activeBrokers` methods using the `put` and `iterate` methods from the `RocksDBKeyValueStorage` class.

The `BrokerRocksDBStorage` class also defines a companion object `BrokerRocksDBStorage` that extends the `RocksDBKeyValueCompanion` trait. This object provides a factory method `apply` that creates a new instance of `BrokerRocksDBStorage` with the given parameters.

Overall, this code provides a way to store and retrieve information about brokers in the Alephium network. It is likely used in other parts of the Alephium project to keep track of broker discovery state information. Here is an example of how this code might be used:

```
val storage = new RocksDBSource(...)
val brokerStorage = BrokerRocksDBStorage(storage, ...)
val brokerInfo = BrokerInfo(...)
brokerStorage.addBroker(brokerInfo)
val activeBrokers = brokerStorage.activeBrokers()
```
