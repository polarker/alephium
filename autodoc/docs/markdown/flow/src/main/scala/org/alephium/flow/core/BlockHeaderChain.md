[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/alephium/alephium/blob/master/flow/src/main/scala/org/alephium/flow/core/BlockHeaderChain.scala)

This code defines a trait called `BlockHeaderChain` that provides functionality for managing a chain of block headers. It extends two other traits, `BlockHeaderPool` and `BlockHashChain`, and uses several other classes and traits from the `org.alephium` package.

The `BlockHeaderChain` trait defines methods for adding and retrieving block headers, as well as checking their completeness and canonicality. It also provides methods for managing the chain's tips and syncing data with other nodes.

The `BlockHeaderChain` trait is designed to be mixed in with other classes that provide specific implementations of its abstract methods. For example, the `headerStorage` method is abstract and must be implemented by a concrete class that provides storage for block headers.

The `BlockHeaderChain` trait is used in the larger `alephium` project to manage the chain of block headers in the Alephium blockchain. It provides a high-level interface for adding and retrieving block headers, as well as managing the chain's tips and syncing data with other nodes. It is a key component of the Alephium blockchain's consensus mechanism.
