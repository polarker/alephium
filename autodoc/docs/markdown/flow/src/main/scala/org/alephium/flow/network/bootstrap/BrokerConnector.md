The `BrokerConnector` class is part of the Alephium project and is responsible for connecting to a broker and exchanging messages during the bootstrap phase of the network. The bootstrap phase is the initial phase of the network where nodes connect to each other and exchange information about the network topology. The `BrokerConnector` class is used to connect to a broker and exchange information about the network topology with other nodes.

The `BrokerConnector` class is an Akka actor that communicates with other actors in the system using messages. The class has three states: `receive`, `forwardCliqueInfo`, and `awaitAck`. In the `receive` state, the actor waits for a `Received` message containing a `Message.Peer` object. When it receives this message, it forwards the `peer.info` object to the `cliqueCoordinator` actor and transitions to the `forwardCliqueInfo` state.

In the `forwardCliqueInfo` state, the actor waits for a `Send` message containing an `IntraCliqueInfo` object. When it receives this message, it serializes the `IntraCliqueInfo` object into a `Message.Clique` object and sends it to the broker using the `connectionHandler` actor. The actor then transitions to the `awaitAck` state.

In the `awaitAck` state, the actor waits for a `Received` message containing an `ack` object. When it receives this message, it forwards the `ack` object to the `cliqueCoordinator` actor and transitions to the `forwardReady` state.

In the `forwardReady` state, the actor waits for a `CliqueCoordinator.Ready` message. When it receives this message, it serializes a `Message.Ready` object and sends it to the broker using the `connectionHandler` actor. If the actor receives a `Terminated` message, it logs a message and stops itself.

The `BrokerConnector` class is used to connect to a broker and exchange information about the network topology during the bootstrap phase of the network. The class is used by other actors in the system to connect to the network and exchange information with other nodes. For example, the `cliqueCoordinator` actor uses the `BrokerConnector` class to connect to the network and exchange information about the network topology with other nodes. 

Example usage:
```scala
val remoteAddress = new InetSocketAddress("localhost", 8080)
val connection = system.actorOf(TcpOutgoingConnection.props(remoteAddress))
val cliqueCoordinator = system.actorOf(CliqueCoordinator.props())
val brokerConnector = system.actorOf(BrokerConnector.props(remoteAddress, connection, cliqueCoordinator))
brokerConnector ! BrokerConnector.Send(intraCliqueInfo)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `BrokerConnector` class?
- The `BrokerConnector` class is responsible for connecting to a broker and forwarding clique information to the `cliqueCoordinator`.

2. What is the role of the `MyConnectionHandler` class?
- The `MyConnectionHandler` class is a subclass of `ConnectionHandler` and is responsible for handling incoming messages from the broker during the bootstrap phase.

3. What is the purpose of the `Received` and `Send` case classes?
- The `Received` case class is used to represent an incoming message from the broker, while the `Send` case class is used to send clique information to the broker.
