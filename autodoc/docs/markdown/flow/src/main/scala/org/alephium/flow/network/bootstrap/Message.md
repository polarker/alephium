This file contains code for defining and serializing/deserializing messages used in the Alephium network bootstrap process. The bootstrap process is used to establish initial connections between nodes in the network. 

The `Message` trait defines four types of messages: `Peer`, `Clique`, `Ack`, and `Ready`. The `Peer` message contains information about a peer node, while the `Clique` message contains information about a group of nodes that are already connected. The `Ack` message is used to acknowledge receipt of a message, and the `Ready` message indicates that a node is ready to start the bootstrap process.

The `Message` object also defines two methods for serializing and deserializing messages. The `serializeBody` method takes a `Message` object and returns a `ByteString` representation of the message. The `deserializeBody` method takes a `ByteString` and returns a `SerdeResult` containing the deserialized `Message` object.

The `PeerInfo` and `IntraCliqueInfo` classes are used to store information about peer nodes and cliques, respectively. These classes also define their own serialization and deserialization methods.

Overall, this code is an important part of the Alephium network bootstrap process, allowing nodes to exchange information about peers and cliques in order to establish initial connections. Here is an example of how the `Peer` message might be used:

```
val peerInfo = PeerInfo("127.0.0.1", 12345)
val peerMessage = Message.Peer(peerInfo)
val serializedMessage = Message.serializeBody(peerMessage)
// send serializedMessage to another node
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Message` trait and its subclasses?
- The `Message` trait and its subclasses define different types of messages that can be sent during the bootstrap process of the Alephium network.

2. What is the `serializeBody` method used for?
- The `serializeBody` method is used to serialize a `Message` object into a `ByteString` representation that can be sent over the network.

3. What is the `deserializeBody` method used for?
- The `deserializeBody` method is used to deserialize a `ByteString` representation of a `Message` object back into its original form, using the appropriate deserialization method based on the message type code.
