The `DiscoveryServer` is a class that implements a variant of the Kademlia protocol for peer-to-peer (P2P) discovery in the Alephium project. The purpose of this code is to enable nodes in the network to discover and communicate with each other. 

The `DiscoveryServer` class extends `IOBaseActor` and `Stash` and imports several dependencies. It defines a set of case classes and traits that represent commands and events that can be sent and received by the server. It also defines a set of properties and methods that implement the Kademlia protocol, such as `getNeighbors`, `fetchNeighbors`, `handlePayload`, and `scheduleScan`. 

The `DiscoveryServer` class has several key features. First, it listens for incoming UDP messages from other nodes in the network. When it receives a message, it deserializes the payload and handles it according to the Kademlia protocol. For example, if it receives a `Ping` message, it responds with a `Pong` message and confirms the peer's address. If it receives a `FindNode` message, it sends back a list of neighbors. 

Second, the `DiscoveryServer` class periodically scans the network for new peers and updates its list of known peers. It does this by sending `FindNode` messages to its neighbors and adding any new peers it discovers to its list. It also periodically pings its neighbors to check if they are still alive. 

Third, the `DiscoveryServer` class handles various commands and events that can be sent to it. For example, it can be asked to return a list of its neighbor peers (`GetNeighborPeers`), or to remove a peer from its list (`Remove`). It can also receive events such as `Unreachable` or `PeerBanned` and take appropriate action, such as marking a peer as unreachable or banning it from the network. 

Overall, the `DiscoveryServer` class plays a critical role in enabling P2P communication in the Alephium network. By implementing the Kademlia protocol and periodically scanning the network for new peers, it ensures that nodes can discover and communicate with each other in a reliable and efficient manner.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a part of the Alephium project and implements a variant of the Kademlia protocol for peer discovery in a P2P network.

2. What are the main components of this code?
- The code defines a DiscoveryServer class that handles UDP communication, manages a list of known peers, and implements the Kademlia protocol for peer discovery. It also defines several case classes and traits for messages and events used by the DiscoveryServer.

3. What is the significance of the `MisbehaviorManager` actor reference?
- The `MisbehaviorManager` actor reference is used to manage misbehaving peers in the network. When a peer sends a message to the DiscoveryServer, the server can use the `MisbehaviorManager` to confirm the peer's identity and ban it if necessary.
