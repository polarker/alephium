This code is a configuration file for the logging system used in the Alephium project. The purpose of this code is to define the format and destination of log messages generated by the project. 

The code defines three different appenders, each with a different destination for log messages. The first appender, named "ERRFILE", writes log messages to a rolling file located at `${ALEPHIUM_HOME:-${user.home}/.alephium}/logs/alephium-errors.log`. The second appender, named "INFOFILE", writes log messages to a rolling file located at `${ALEPHIUM_HOME:-${user.home}/.alephium}/logs/alephium.log`. The third appender, named "CONSOLE", writes log messages to the console.

Each appender has a different log level threshold, which determines which log messages are written to that appender. The "ERRFILE" appender only writes log messages with a level of WARN or higher, while the "INFOFILE" appender writes log messages with a level equal to or higher than the value of the `${ALEPHIUM_FILE_LOG_LEVEL}` environment variable (or OFF if the variable is not set). The "CONSOLE" appender writes log messages with a level equal to or higher than the value of the `${ALEPHIUM_CONSOLE_LOG_LEVEL}` environment variable (or INFO if the variable is not set).

All three appenders use the same log message format, which is defined by the `defaultPattern` property. This format includes the date and time of the log message, the thread that generated the message, the log level, the name of the logger that generated the message, and the message itself.

The code also includes a logger configuration for the `io.netty` package, which sets the log level to WARN. This means that log messages generated by classes in the `io.netty` package with a level of INFO or DEBUG will not be written to any of the appenders defined in this configuration file.

Overall, this code is an important part of the Alephium project's logging system, as it defines the format and destination of log messages generated by the project. Developers working on the project can use this code to customize the logging system to meet their needs, such as changing the log message format or adding additional appenders.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    
    This code is a configuration file for logging in the Alephium project, specifying the format and destination of log messages.

2. What logging libraries or frameworks are being used in this code?
    
    This code is using the Logback logging framework, specifically the `ch.qos.logback` package.

3. What is the significance of the `defaultPattern` property?
    
    The `defaultPattern` property specifies the format of log messages, including the date, thread, log level, logger name, and message itself. This format is used by the `encoder` property of each appender to format log messages before they are written to their respective destinations.
