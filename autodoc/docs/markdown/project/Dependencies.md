This file contains the dependencies required for the Alephium project. The purpose of this file is to define the versions of the libraries and frameworks that the project depends on. 

The `Version` object contains the versions of the different libraries and frameworks used in the project. These versions are used in the `Dependencies` object to define the dependencies required for the project. 

For example, the `akka` library is used for actor-based concurrency in the project. The `Dependencies` object defines the `akka` dependency with the version specified in the `Version` object. Similarly, other dependencies such as `vertx`, `upickle`, `ficus`, `bcprov`, `fastparse`, `logback`, `rocksdb`, `scala-logging`, `scalacheck`, `scalatest`, `scalatestplus`, and `weupnp` are defined with their respective versions. 

The `tapir` library is used for defining and documenting HTTP APIs in the project. The `Dependencies` object defines the `tapir` dependencies required for the project, such as `tapir-core`, `tapir-server`, `tapir-vertx`, `tapir-openapi`, `tapir-openapi-model`, `tapir-swagger-ui`, and `tapir-client`. 

The `sttp` library is used for making HTTP requests in the project. The `Dependencies` object defines the `sttp` dependency with the version specified in the `Version` object. 

The `prometheus` library is used for monitoring metrics in the project. The `Dependencies` object defines the `prometheus` dependencies required for the project, such as `prometheus-simple-client`, `prometheus-simple-client-common`, and `prometheus-simple-client-hotspot`. 

Overall, this file is an important part of the Alephium project as it defines the dependencies required for the project to function properly. By keeping the versions of the dependencies up-to-date, the project can benefit from the latest features and bug fixes of the libraries and frameworks used.
