This file contains the configuration for the Scalastyle tool, which is used to enforce coding standards and best practices in Scala code. The configuration specifies a set of checks that are applied to the code, and any violations of these checks will result in an error being reported.

The checks cover a wide range of areas, including file length, line length, naming conventions, whitespace usage, and code complexity. For example, the `FileLengthChecker` ensures that files do not exceed a maximum length of 800 lines, while the `ClassNamesChecker` enforces a naming convention where class names must start with an uppercase letter followed by one or more letters.

The configuration also includes custom checks that are specific to the Alephium project. For example, the `HeaderMatchesChecker` ensures that all files contain a specific copyright header, while the `ImportOrderChecker` enforces a specific order for imports.

The configuration can be used as part of a continuous integration process to ensure that all code adheres to the specified standards. Developers can also run the tool locally to check their code before committing it.

Example usage:

```
sbt scalastyle
```

This command will run the Scalastyle tool using the configuration specified in this file, and report any errors or warnings that are found.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   
   This code is a configuration file for Scalastyle, a tool used for enforcing coding standards in Scala code.

2. What are some of the specific coding standards being enforced by this configuration file?
   
   This configuration file enforces standards related to file length, line length, whitespace, naming conventions, magic numbers, cyclomatic complexity, method length, and import order, among others.

3. Are there any custom rules being enforced by this configuration file?
   
   Yes, there are several custom rules being enforced related to regex patterns and header matching. For example, the file checks for the use of certain words in code comments and provides custom messages for certain regex patterns. It also checks that the header of each file matches a specific license.
