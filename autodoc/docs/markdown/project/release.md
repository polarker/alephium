This bash script is used to update the version number of the Alephium project and commit the changes to the repository. The script takes in a new version number as an argument and performs several checks to ensure that the version number is valid and that the script is being run on the correct branch with no uncommitted changes.

Once the checks have passed, the script uses the `sed` command to update the version number in two files: `openapi.json` and all `.json` files in the `ralphc/src/test/resources` directory. The `sed` command uses regular expressions to find and replace the old version number with the new version number.

The script then adds and commits the changes to the repository, creates a new tag with the new version number, and pushes the changes and tag to the remote repository.

This script is likely used as part of a larger release process for the Alephium project. By automating the version number update and commit process, this script helps ensure that the project's version numbers are consistent and up-to-date across all relevant files. This can help prevent errors and confusion when working with different versions of the project. 

Example usage:
```
./update_version.sh 1.2.3
```
This would update the version number to `1.2.3` and commit the changes to the repository.
