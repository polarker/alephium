The `Documentation` trait is a part of the Alephium project and provides functionality for generating documentation for the Alephium API. It defines an OpenAPI specification for the API and includes endpoints for various blockchain-related operations.

The trait extends the `Endpoints` trait, which defines the endpoints for the Alephium API. It also extends the `OpenAPIDocsInterpreter` trait, which provides functionality for converting Tapir endpoints to OpenAPI specifications.

The `Documentation` trait defines two methods: `walletEndpoints` and `port`. The `walletEndpoints` method returns a list of Tapir endpoints for wallet-related operations. The `port` method returns the port number on which the API is running.

The trait also defines two lazy values: `blockflowEndpoints` and `servers`. The `blockflowEndpoints` value is a list of Tapir endpoints for blockchain-related operations. The `servers` value is a list of OpenAPI servers that the API can be accessed from.

The `openAPI` lazy value is the main output of the `Documentation` trait. It is an OpenAPI specification for the Alephium API, generated using the `toOpenAPI` method from the `OpenAPIDocsInterpreter` trait. The `toOpenAPI` method takes a list of Tapir endpoints, an API title, and an API version as arguments, and returns an OpenAPI specification.

The `openAPI` specification includes the endpoints defined in both the `walletEndpoints` and `blockflowEndpoints` lists, as well as the servers defined in the `servers` list. The specification also includes information about the API title and version.

Overall, the `Documentation` trait provides a convenient way to generate documentation for the Alephium API using the OpenAPI specification. It defines the endpoints for both wallet-related and blockchain-related operations, and allows for customization of the API servers.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Documentation` trait and what does it include?
