The `ShutdownTest` file is a part of the Alephium project and contains test cases for shutting down the node and clique. The purpose of this code is to ensure that the node and clique can be properly shut down in different scenarios.

The file imports necessary libraries such as `java.net.InetSocketAddress`, `akka.actor.Terminated`, `akka.io.{IO, Tcp}`, `akka.testkit.TestProbe`, and `org.alephium.util._`. It defines a class `ShutdownTest` that extends `AlephiumActorSpec`, which is a test kit for Akka actors.

The first test case `should "shutdown the node when Tcp port is used"` creates a `TestProbe` connection and binds it to a local IP address and a default master port. Then, it boots a node with the same default master port and broker ID 0. The `restServer` is called as a lazy value. Finally, it checks if the `flowSystem` of the server is terminated.

The second test case `should "shutdown the clique when one node of the clique is down"` boots a clique with two nodes. Then, it stops the first node and checks if the `flowSystem` of the second node is terminated.

These test cases ensure that the node and clique can be properly shut down in different scenarios, such as when a TCP port is used or when one node of the clique is down. This code is important for the larger project as it ensures that the system can be properly shut down and restarted without any issues.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ShutdownTest` class?
- The `ShutdownTest` class is a test suite that checks if the node and clique can be properly shut down under certain conditions.

2. What is the `CliqueFixture` class used for?
- The `CliqueFixture` class is used to set up a test environment for testing the behavior of a clique, which is a group of nodes that communicate with each other.

3. What is the significance of the `is a[Terminated]` assertion?
- The `is a[Terminated]` assertion checks if the future value of the `flowSystem.whenTerminated` method is an instance of the `Terminated` class, which indicates that the actor system has been terminated properly.
