The code provided is a part of the Alephium project and contains a class called `Injected` and an object called `Injected`. The `Injected` class is a subclass of `ActorRefT` and overrides the `!` method. The `Injected` object contains four methods that return an instance of the `Injected` class.

The `Injected` class is used to modify the messages sent to an actor before they are delivered. The `injection` parameter is a function that takes a `ByteString` and returns a modified `ByteString`. The `ref` parameter is the actor that will receive the modified messages. The `!` method is overridden to intercept the messages and apply the `injection` function before forwarding the modified message to the `ref` actor.

The `Injected` object contains four methods that return an instance of the `Injected` class. The `noModification` method returns an instance of `Injected` with an identity function as the `injection` parameter. The `message` method takes a `PartialFunction[Message, Message]` and returns an instance of `Injected` that modifies the payload of the `Message` objects that match the `PartialFunction`. The `payload` method takes a `PartialFunction[Payload, Payload]` and returns an instance of `Injected` that modifies the `Payload` objects of the `Message` objects that match the `PartialFunction`. The `apply` method is a factory method that returns an instance of `Injected` with the given `injection` function and `ref` actor.

The purpose of the `Injected` class and object is to provide a way to modify the messages sent to an actor before they are delivered. This can be useful for testing or debugging purposes. The `Injected` class and object are used in the `InterCliqueSyncTest` class to modify the messages sent between nodes in a clique. The `InterCliqueSyncTest` class contains several tests that check the behavior of the clique network under different conditions, such as when nodes are added or removed, or when messages are modified or dropped.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Injected` class and its companion object?
- The `Injected` class is a wrapper around an `ActorRef` that allows for modification of messages before they are sent. The companion object provides factory methods for creating instances of `Injected` with different types of message modification.
2. What is the `InterCliqueSyncTest` class testing?
- The `InterCliqueSyncTest` class is testing the synchronization of two separate "cliques" of nodes in the Alephium network, as well as various forms of misbehavior and punishment.
3. What license is this code released under?
- This code is released under the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3 or later.
