This code defines a test suite for sweeping funds from Alephium wallets. The `SweepTest` class is an abstract class that extends `AlephiumActorSpec`, which is a base class for Alephium actor tests. The `SweepTest` class has two test cases: `sweep amounts from the active address` and `sweep amounts from all addresses`. These test cases are defined using the `it should` syntax, which is a BDD-style syntax for defining tests.

The `SweepTest` class has a nested trait called `SweepFixture`, which is used to set up the test environment. The `SweepFixture` trait extends `CliqueFixture`, which is a base class for Alephium clique tests. The `SweepFixture` trait starts a clique with one node, creates a wallet, generates some addresses, sends funds to those addresses, and confirms the transactions. The `SweepFixture` trait also defines some helper methods for sweeping funds from the wallet.

The `SweepTest` class has two concrete subclasses: `SweepMiner` and `SweepNoneMiner`. These subclasses are used to test sweeping funds from wallets of miners and non-miners, respectively. The only difference between these subclasses is the number of addresses generated by the `SweepFixture` trait. If the `isMiner` parameter is true, then four addresses are generated; otherwise, only one address is generated.

The purpose of this code is to test the functionality of sweeping funds from Alephium wallets. Sweeping funds means transferring all the funds from one or more addresses to another address. This is useful when consolidating funds or when moving funds to a new wallet. The `SweepTest` class tests two scenarios: sweeping funds from the active address and sweeping funds from all addresses. The `SweepFixture` trait sets up the test environment by creating a clique, a wallet, and some addresses. The test cases use the `request` method to call the Alephium API and verify that the funds are swept correctly. The `eventually` method is used to retry the verification until the condition is met.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SweepTest` class and its subclasses `SweepMiner` and `SweepNoneMiner`?
- The `SweepTest` class is an abstract class that defines tests for sweeping amounts from addresses in a wallet. Its subclasses `SweepMiner` and `SweepNoneMiner` implement these tests for scenarios where the wallet belongs to a miner or a non-miner, respectively.

2. What is the `SweepFixture` trait and what does it do?
- The `SweepFixture` trait is a trait that defines a set of common variables and methods used in the tests defined in the `SweepTest` class. It sets up a Clique network with a single node, creates a wallet with a specified number of addresses, and performs transfers to these addresses to set up the initial balances for testing.

3. What is the purpose of the `eventually` block in the tests?
- The `eventually` block is used to wait for a certain condition to be true before proceeding with the test. In this case, it is used to wait for the balances of the addresses in the wallet to be updated after sweeping amounts from them, and to check that the expected balances have been reached.
