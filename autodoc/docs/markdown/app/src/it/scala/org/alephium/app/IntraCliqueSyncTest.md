The `IntraCliqueSyncTest` class is a test suite for testing the synchronization of nodes within a clique in the Alephium project. The purpose of this code is to ensure that nodes within a clique can synchronize with each other and that the synchronization process works as expected. 

The class imports several dependencies, including `sttp.model.StatusCode`, which is used to represent HTTP status codes, and several classes from the Alephium project, including `SelfClique` and `ChainIndex`. The `IntraCliqueSyncTest` class extends `AlephiumActorSpec`, which is a base class for testing actors in the Alephium project.

The class contains two test cases, each of which tests the synchronization of nodes within a clique. The first test case tests the synchronization of a single node clique, while the second test case tests the synchronization of a two-node clique. 

In the first test case, a single node is booted, and the server is started. The test then waits for the node to become ready by checking the `selfReady` field of the `SelfClique` object returned by the `getSelfClique` method. Finally, the server is stopped.

In the second test case, two nodes are booted, and the first node is started. Blocks are then mined and added to the blockchain, and the test waits for the blocks to be added to the blockchain by checking the `blockFlow` field of the node. The second node is then started, and the test waits for both nodes to become ready by checking the `selfReady` field of the `SelfClique` object returned by the `getSelfClique` method. Finally, both nodes are stopped.

Overall, the `IntraCliqueSyncTest` class is an important part of the Alephium project's testing suite, as it ensures that nodes within a clique can synchronize with each other and that the synchronization process works as expected.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `IntraCliqueSyncTest` class?
- The `IntraCliqueSyncTest` class is a test suite for booting and syncing single and multiple node cliques in the Alephium project.

2. What is the `CliqueFixture` used for in the test methods?
- The `CliqueFixture` is used to set up a test environment for each test method, including booting nodes and mining blocks.

3. What is the significance of the `eventually` keyword used in the test methods?
- The `eventually` keyword is used to retry a test assertion until it succeeds or times out, allowing for asynchronous behavior in the test environment.
