The `Json` object in the `org.alephium.json` package provides utility methods for working with JSON data. The object is implemented using the ujson library, which provides a lightweight and fast JSON parser and serializer for Scala.

The `Json` object defines several implicit conversions and methods for working with JSON data. The `fromString` method is an implicit conversion that converts a string to a `ujson.Readable` object, which can be used to parse JSON data. The `OptionWriter` and `OptionReader` methods are implicit conversions that allow `Option` types to be serialized and deserialized to and from JSON. The `readOpt` method is a utility method that attempts to read a JSON value as an instance of a given type, returning `None` if the value is null or missing.

The `dropNullValues` method is a utility method that removes null values from a JSON object or array. The method recursively traverses the JSON data structure, replacing null values with `None` and removing any key-value pairs or array elements that contain null values. The resulting JSON data structure is returned as a `ujson.Value` object.

Overall, the `Json` object provides a convenient and efficient way to work with JSON data in the Alephium project. Developers can use the methods provided by the `Json` object to parse, serialize, and manipulate JSON data as needed. For example, the `readOpt` method can be used to deserialize JSON data into Scala case classes, while the `dropNullValues` method can be used to remove null values from JSON data before it is stored or transmitted.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a Scala object called `Json` that provides methods for parsing and manipulating JSON data.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code imports `ujson` and uses its `Readable` and `StringParser` classes for parsing JSON data.
- This code also uses the `upickle` library for JSON serialization and deserialization.

3. What is the purpose of the `dropNullValues` method?
- The `dropNullValues` method takes a `ujson.Value` object and recursively removes any null values from it, returning a new `ujson.Value` object with the null values removed.
