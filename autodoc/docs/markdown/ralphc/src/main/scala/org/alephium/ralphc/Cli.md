The `Cli` class is responsible for handling the command-line interface (CLI) for the Alephium compiler, `ralphc`. The `Cli` class is a Scala case class that defines a set of command-line options that can be passed to the `ralphc` compiler. The `Cli` class uses the `scopt` library to define and parse the command-line options.

The `Cli` class has a `call` method that takes an array of command-line arguments and returns an integer exit code. The `call` method parses the command-line arguments using the `scopt` library and then calls the `Compiler` class to compile the Alephium contracts. The `call` method returns the sum of the exit codes from the `compileProject` method of the `Compiler` class.

The `Cli` class has several private methods that are used to handle errors, warnings, and debug messages. The `validateFolders` method is used to validate that the contract and artifact folders are valid directories. The `debug` method is used to print debug messages if the `debug` option is enabled. The `error` method is used to print error messages if there is an error while compiling the contracts. The `warning` method is used to print warning messages if there are warnings while compiling the contracts.

The `Cli` class is used in the larger Alephium project to provide a command-line interface for the `ralphc` compiler. The `ralphc` compiler is used to compile Alephium contracts into bytecode that can be executed on the Alephium blockchain. The `Cli` class provides a convenient way for developers to compile their contracts and check for errors and warnings before deploying them to the Alephium blockchain.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a command-line interface (CLI) for the `ralphc` tool, which compiles Alephium smart contracts.

2. What are the available options for the `ralphc` tool?
- The available options include specifying contract and artifact folders, treating warnings as errors, ignoring specific types of warnings, enabling debug mode, and printing usage or version information.

3. What is the expected input format for the `ralphc` tool?
- The `ralphc` tool expects a list of command-line arguments, which are parsed using the `scopt` library. The arguments can include options and values for contract and artifact folders, as well as other configuration settings.
