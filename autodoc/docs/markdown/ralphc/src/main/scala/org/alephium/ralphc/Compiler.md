The `Compiler` object is responsible for compiling Alephium smart contracts. It takes a `Config` object as input, which contains the paths to the contracts and artifacts directories, as well as the compiler options. The `compileProject` method is the main entry point for the compiler. It first calls the `analysisCodes` method to analyze the source code of the contracts and generate metadata about them. It then calls the `ralph.Compiler.compileProject` method to compile the contracts and scripts. The resulting bytecode and metadata are written to the artifacts directory.

The `analysisCodes` method reads the source code of the contracts, computes a hash of each contract's source code, and generates metadata about each contract. The metadata includes the contract's name, path to the artifact file, and the hash of the source code. The metadata is stored in a mutable map called `metaInfos`.

The `compileProject` method calls `ralph.Compiler.compileProject` to compile the contracts and scripts. The resulting bytecode and metadata are written to the artifacts directory. The method returns an `Either` object, which contains either a `CompileProjectResult` object or an error message.

The `Compiler` object uses the `Codec` object to serialize and deserialize the metadata and bytecode. The `Codec` object defines implicit `ReadWriter` objects for the various case classes used in the compiler.

The `Compiler` object also defines two utility methods: `writer` and `getSourceFiles`. The `writer` method writes a serialized object to a file. The `getSourceFiles` method recursively searches a directory for files with a given extension and returns a sequence of paths to those files.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a compiler for Alephium smart contracts written in the `.ral` language. It compiles the contracts and generates artifacts in the form of JSON files.

2. What is the role of the `metaInfos` variable?
- `metaInfos` is a mutable map that stores metadata information about the contracts being compiled. It maps the contract name to its corresponding `MetaInfo` object, which contains information such as the contract's source code, bytecode, and warnings.

3. What is the purpose of the `deleteFile` function?
- The `deleteFile` function is a recursive function that deletes a file or directory and all its contents. It is used to clean up the artifacts directory before generating new artifacts.
