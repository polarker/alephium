The code defines a custom `Duration` class that represents a duration of time in milliseconds. The class provides methods to convert the duration to seconds, minutes, and hours. It also provides methods to perform arithmetic operations with other `Duration` instances, such as addition and subtraction, as well as scaling operations with a `Long` value. 

The `Duration` class is defined as an `AnyVal` to minimize the overhead of creating new objects. The class also implements the `Ordered` trait to allow for comparison with other `Duration` instances.

The `Duration` object provides several factory methods to create instances of the `Duration` class. These methods allow for creating instances from milliseconds, seconds, minutes, hours, and days. There are also corresponding "unsafe" methods that create instances without checking for negative values.

The `Duration` object also provides a method to convert a `java.time.Duration` instance to a `Duration` instance. This method is useful for interoperability with other libraries that use the `java.time` API.

Overall, this code provides a useful utility class for working with durations of time in a type-safe and efficient manner. It can be used throughout the larger project to represent time intervals and durations. 

Example usage:
```scala
val duration1 = Duration.ofMinutes(5).get
val duration2 = Duration.ofSeconds(30).get

val sum = duration1 + duration2
val difference = duration1 - duration2

println(sum.toSeconds) // prints 330
println(difference.toSeconds) // prints 270
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Duration` class?
   
   The `Duration` class represents a duration of time in milliseconds and provides methods for converting to seconds, minutes, hours, and Scala's `FiniteDuration` class.

2. What is the difference between the `times` and `timesUnsafe` methods?
   
   The `times` method returns an `Option[Duration]` representing the result of multiplying the duration by a given scale, while `timesUnsafe` returns a `Duration` and throws an exception if the result is not positive.

3. What is the purpose of the `unsafe` and `from` methods?
   
   The `unsafe` method creates a new `Duration` instance with a given number of milliseconds, assuming that the duration is positive. The `from` method returns an `Option[Duration]` representing the duration if it is positive, or `None` otherwise.
