The `FutureCollection` object in the `org.alephium.util` package provides a method for sequentially executing an asynchronous function for each element in a collection. The purpose of this method is to ensure that the processing of the next element in the collection does not start until the previous one has finished. This can be useful in situations where the processing of each element depends on the result of the previous one.

The `foldSequentialE` method takes three type parameters: `I`, `L`, and `R`. `I` represents the type of the elements in the collection, `L` represents the type of the error that can be returned by the asynchronous function, and `R` represents the type of the accumulated result. The method also takes a collection of type `AVector[I]`, an initial value of type `R`, and an asynchronous function of type `(R, I) => Future[Either[L, R]]`. The function takes the accumulated result and an element from the collection and returns a `Future` that either contains an error of type `L` or the updated accumulated result of type `R`.

The `foldSequentialE` method uses recursion to process each element in the collection sequentially. It starts by calling a private method `next` with the initial accumulated result and the collection. The `next` method checks if the collection is empty. If it is, it returns a `Future` containing the accumulated result wrapped in a `Right`. If the collection is not empty, it calls the asynchronous function with the accumulated result and the first element in the collection. The `flatMap` method is used to handle the `Future` returned by the asynchronous function. If the result is an error, it returns a `Future` containing the error wrapped in a `Left`. If the result is the updated accumulated result, it calls `next` recursively with the updated result and the remaining elements in the collection.

This method can be used in the larger project to process collections of elements asynchronously and sequentially. For example, it could be used to process a batch of transactions in a blockchain one at a time, where the processing of each transaction depends on the result of the previous one. The method ensures that the transactions are processed in the correct order and that the processing of each transaction does not start until the previous one has finished.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `FutureCollection` object?
- The `FutureCollection` object provides a method for sequentially executing an asynchronous function for each element in a collection and accumulating the result.

2. What is the input type for the `foldSequentialE` method?
- The input type for the `foldSequentialE` method is `AVector[I]`, where `I` is a type parameter.

3. What is the purpose of the `@SuppressWarnings(Array("org.wartremover.warts.Recursion"))` annotation?
- The `@SuppressWarnings(Array("org.wartremover.warts.Recursion"))` annotation is used to suppress a warning related to the use of recursion in the `foldSequentialE` method.
