The code in this file defines a utility function for generating a hash value from a given input ByteString using the DJB hash algorithm. The purpose of this function is to provide a fast and efficient way to generate unique hash values for data that can be used for various purposes within the larger Alephium project.

The `DjbHash` object contains a single method called `intHash` that takes a `ByteString` as input and returns an `Int` value representing the hash of the input data. The hash value is generated using the DJB hash algorithm, which is a simple and fast hash function that is commonly used in various applications.

The `intHash` method works by initializing a hash value of 5381 and then iterating over each byte in the input `ByteString`. For each byte, the hash value is updated using the following formula: `hash = ((hash << 5) + hash) + (byte & 0xff)`. This formula is a variation of the original DJB hash algorithm that is optimized for performance.

Once all bytes in the input `ByteString` have been processed, the final hash value is returned as an `Int`. This hash value can be used for various purposes within the Alephium project, such as indexing data in a hash table or verifying the integrity of data.

Here is an example of how the `intHash` method can be used:

```
import org.alephium.util.DjbHash
import akka.util.ByteString

val data = ByteString("hello world")
val hash = DjbHash.intHash(data)
println(hash) // prints 222957957
```

In this example, a `ByteString` containing the text "hello world" is passed to the `intHash` method, which generates a hash value of 222957957. This hash value can be used to uniquely identify the input data and perform various operations on it within the Alephium project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `DjbHash` object?
   - The `DjbHash` object provides a method `intHash` that takes a `ByteString` as input and returns an integer hash value.
2. What algorithm is used to calculate the hash value?
   - The `intHash` method uses the DJB2 hash algorithm, which is a non-cryptographic hash function.
3. Why is `scalastyle` turned off for the `magic.number` rule in the code?
   - The `magic.number` rule is turned off because the number `5381` used in the `intHash` method is a well-known constant in the DJB2 hash algorithm and is not considered a "magic number" in this context.
