The code defines a class `ActorRefT` that wraps an `ActorRef` object and provides additional methods for interacting with the actor. The purpose of this class is to simplify the usage of actors in the Alephium project by providing a more convenient and type-safe interface.

The `ActorRefT` class provides four methods for sending messages to the actor: `!`, `forward`, `ask`, and `tell`. The `!` method sends a message to the actor with an optional sender, the `forward` method forwards a message to the actor with the original sender, the `ask` method sends a message to the actor and returns a `Future` with the response, and the `tell` method sends a message to the actor with a specific sender. These methods are all defined with a type parameter `T` that specifies the type of message being sent.

The `ActorRefT` class also overrides the `equals` and `hashCode` methods to compare the underlying `ActorRef` object.

The `ActorRefT` object provides three factory methods for creating instances of the `ActorRefT` class. The `apply` method creates an `ActorRefT` object from an existing `ActorRef` object. The `build` method creates a new actor with the specified `Props` and returns an `ActorRefT` object for interacting with it. The `build` method with a name parameter creates a new actor with the specified name and `Props` and returns an `ActorRefT` object for interacting with it.

Overall, this code provides a convenient and type-safe interface for interacting with actors in the Alephium project. It simplifies the usage of actors by providing a set of methods that cover common use cases and by wrapping the `ActorRef` object in a type-safe class. This code can be used throughout the project to interact with actors and send messages to them. For example, the `ask` method can be used to send a message to an actor and wait for a response, while the `tell` method can be used to send a message to an actor with a specific sender.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ActorRefT` class?
- The `ActorRefT` class is a wrapper around an `ActorRef` that provides additional methods for sending messages to the actor, forwarding messages, and asking for a response.

2. What is the purpose of the `build` methods in the `ActorRefT` object?
- The `build` methods are convenience methods for creating an `ActorRefT` instance from an `ActorSystem` and `Props`. The second `build` method also allows specifying a name for the actor.

3. What is the license for this code and where can it be found?
