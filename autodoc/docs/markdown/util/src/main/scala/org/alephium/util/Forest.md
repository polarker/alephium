The `Forest` class is a data structure that represents a forest, which is a collection of trees. Each tree is represented by a `Node` object, which contains a key, a value, and a list of child nodes. The `Forest` class provides methods for building, manipulating, and querying the forest.

The `Forest` class has two constructors: `tryBuild` and `build`. The `tryBuild` constructor takes a vector of values, a function to extract a key from each value, and a function to extract the key of the parent node from each value. It returns an `Option[Forest[K, T]]`, which is `Some(forest)` if the forest can be built from the values, and `None` otherwise. The `build` constructor takes a single value and a function to extract a key from the value, and returns a new `Forest` containing a single root node with the given value.

The `Forest` class provides methods for querying the forest. The `contains` method takes a key and returns `true` if the forest contains a node with that key, and `false` otherwise. The `flatten` method returns a vector of all the nodes in the forest, in depth-first order.

The `Forest` class also provides methods for manipulating the forest. The `removeRootNode` method takes a key and removes the root node with that key from the forest, returning the removed node. If the node has children, the children are added to the forest as new root nodes. The `removeBranch` method takes a key and removes the entire tree rooted at the node with that key from the forest, returning the removed node.

The `Forest` class is used in the larger `alephium` project to represent the blockchain. Each block in the blockchain is represented by a `Node` object, and the entire blockchain is represented by a `Forest` object. The `Forest` class provides methods for querying and manipulating the blockchain, such as checking if a block is in the blockchain, adding a block to the blockchain, and removing a block from the blockchain.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Forest` class and its associated `Node` class?
- The `Forest` class represents a forest data structure, which is a collection of trees, and the `Node` class represents a node in the tree.
2. What is the difference between the `tryBuild` and `build` methods in the `Forest` object?
- The `tryBuild` method attempts to build a forest from a collection of values, while the `build` method builds a forest from a single value.
3. Why does the `Forest` class use `mutable.ArrayBuffer` instead of `Set` for storing nodes?
- The `mutable.ArrayBuffer` is used instead of `Set` because the number of forks in a blockchain is usually small, and `ArrayBuffer` provides better performance for small collections.
