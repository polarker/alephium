The `DBV110ToV100` object is a Scala script that is part of the Alephium project. The purpose of this script is to downgrade the database version of the Alephium node from version 1.1.0 to version 1.0.0. This is useful in case a user wants to switch back to an older version of the Alephium node that is not compatible with the newer database version.

The script achieves this by performing the following steps:

1. It defines the root path of the Alephium node's database, which is located in the user's home directory under the `.alephium/mainnet` folder.
2. It defines two byte arrays that represent the names of two column families in the RocksDB database used by the Alephium node: `ColumnFamily.Broker` and `ColumnFamily.All`.
3. It defines a byte array that represents the key used to store the database version in the database.
4. It defines two byte arrays that represent the serialized versions of the `DatabaseVersion` object for versions 1.0.0 and 1.1.0.
5. It creates a `RocksDBSource` object that represents the RocksDB database used by the Alephium node.
6. It searches for the `ColumnFamily.All` column family in the database and retrieves its handle.
7. It retrieves the current database version from the `ColumnFamily.All` column family using the `dbVersionKey` key.
8. If the current database version is 1.1.0, it drops the `ColumnFamily.Broker` column family from the database and sets the database version to 1.0.0.

Overall, this script is a utility that is used to downgrade the database version of the Alephium node. It is not meant to be used directly by end-users, but rather as part of the Alephium node's upgrade and downgrade process.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    
    This code is a Scala script that converts the database version of the Alephium blockchain from version 1.1.0 to version 1.0.0 by modifying the database stored in RocksDB.

2. What is the input and output of this code?
    
    The input of this code is the database stored in RocksDB with version 1.1.0, and the output is the modified database with version 1.0.0.
