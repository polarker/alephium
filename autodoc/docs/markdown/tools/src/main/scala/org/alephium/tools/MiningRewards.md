The `MiningRewards` object in the `alephium.tools` package is a Scala script that calculates the inflation rate of the Alephium cryptocurrency based on the current hashrate and over time. The script imports several classes from the `org.alephium` package, including `ALPH`, `GroupConfig`, `Emission`, `Duration`, `Number`, and `U256`.

The `MiningRewards` object defines a `groupConfig` object that specifies the number of groups in the Alephium network. It also defines a `blockTargetTime` object that specifies the target time for mining a block in seconds. The `emission` object is then defined as an instance of the `Emission` class, which takes the `groupConfig` and `blockTargetTime` objects as parameters.

The `calInflation` method is a private method that takes a `yearlyReward` of type `U256` as a parameter and returns the inflation rate as a `BigDecimal`. The method first converts the `yearlyReward` to an amount of ALPH per year, then divides that amount by one billion to get the inflation rate as a decimal.

The `printLine` method is a custom method that prints a string to the console with a newline character at the end.

The `MiningRewards` object then prints two tables to the console. The first table shows the inflation rate according to the hashrate, while the second table shows the inflation rate over time. Both tables use the `rewardsWrtTarget` and `rewardsWrtTime` methods of the `emission` object to get the yearly reward for each hashrate and year, respectively. The `foreach` method is used to iterate over each hashrate and year and print the corresponding inflation rate, which is calculated using the `calInflation` method.

Overall, this script is a useful tool for understanding the inflation rate of the Alephium cryptocurrency and how it changes over time and with changes in the network's hashrate. It can be used by developers and users of the Alephium network to make informed decisions about investing in and using the cryptocurrency.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `MiningRewards` object?
   - The `MiningRewards` object is used to calculate inflation rates for the Alephium cryptocurrency based on hashrate and time.
2. What is the significance of the `GroupConfig` and `Emission` classes being imported?
   - The `GroupConfig` and `Emission` classes are used to configure and calculate the emission schedule for the Alephium cryptocurrency.
3. What is the purpose of the `calInflation` method?
   - The `calInflation` method is used to calculate the inflation rate for a given yearly reward in terms of the Alephium cryptocurrency.
