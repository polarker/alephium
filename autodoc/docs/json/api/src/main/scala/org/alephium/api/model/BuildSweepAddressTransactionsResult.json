  "summary": "This code defines a case class called `BuildSweepAddressTransactionsResult` and an object with the same name. The case class has three fields: `unsignedTxs`, which is a vector of `SweepAddressTransaction` objects, `fromGroup`, which is an integer representing the index of the group from which the transaction is being sent, and `toGroup`, which is an integer representing the index of the group to which the transaction is being sent. The object has two methods: `from` and `from`. \n\nThe first `from` method takes an `UnsignedTransaction` object and two `GroupIndex` objects as arguments and returns a `BuildSweepAddressTransactionsResult` object. It does this by calling the second `from` method with a vector containing the `UnsignedTransaction` object, the `fromGroup` index, and the `toGroup` index. \n\nThe second `from` method takes a vector of `UnsignedTransaction` objects and two `GroupIndex` objects as arguments and returns a `BuildSweepAddressTransactionsResult` object. It does this by mapping over the vector of `UnsignedTransaction` objects and calling the `from` method of the `SweepAddressTransaction` object on each one, then returning a new `BuildSweepAddressTransactionsResult` object with the resulting vector of `SweepAddressTransaction` objects and the `fromGroup` and `toGroup` indices.\n\nThis code is likely used in the larger project to build a list of sweep address transactions from a vector of unsigned transactions and group indices. The resulting `BuildSweepAddressTransactionsResult` object can then be used in other parts of the project to perform various operations on the sweep address transactions. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nval unsignedTx = UnsignedTransaction(...)\nval fromGroup = GroupIndex(0)\nval toGroup = GroupIndex(1)\n\nval result = BuildSweepAddressTransactionsResult.from(unsignedTx, fromGroup, toGroup)\n// result is a BuildSweepAddressTransactionsResult object\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `BuildSweepAddressTransactionsResult` class?\n   - The `BuildSweepAddressTransactionsResult` class is a case class that holds a vector of `SweepAddressTransaction` objects, along with two group indices representing the source and destination groups.\n2. What is the `from` method used for in the `BuildSweepAddressTransactionsResult` object?\n   - The `from` method is used to create a new `BuildSweepAddressTransactionsResult` object from a vector of `UnsignedTransaction` objects and two group indices representing the source and destination groups.\n3. What is the `SweepAddressTransaction` class and where is it defined?\n   - The `SweepAddressTransaction` class is not defined in this file, but it is imported from `org.alephium.protocol.model`. It is likely defined in another file within the `alephium` project."
