  "summary": "The `TestContract` class is a model that represents a contract to be tested. It contains various parameters that are used to create a `Complete` instance of the contract, which is used for testing. \n\nThe `TestContract` class takes in various parameters such as `group`, `blockHash`, `blockTimeStamp`, `txId`, `address`, `bytecode`, `initialImmFields`, `initialMutFields`, `initialAsset`, `methodIndex`, `args`, `existingContracts`, and `inputAssets`. These parameters are used to create a `Complete` instance of the contract, which is used for testing. \n\nThe `toComplete()` method is used to create a `Complete` instance of the contract. It first checks if the `methodIndex` is valid and then creates a `Complete` instance of the contract using the parameters passed to the `TestContract` instance. \n\nThe `Complete` class is a model that represents a complete contract that is used for testing. It contains various parameters such as `group`, `blockHash`, `blockTimeStamp`, `txId`, `contractId`, `code`, `originalCodeHash`, `initialImmFields`, `initialMutFields`, `initialAsset`, `testMethodIndex`, `testArgs`, `existingContracts`, and `inputAssets`. \n\nThe `codeHash()` method is used to return the original code hash when testing private methods and the new code hash when the test code is migrated. The `groupIndex()` method is used to return the group index of the contract. \n\nOverall, this code is used to create a `TestContract` instance that is used for testing a contract. The `TestContract` instance is then converted to a `Complete` instance, which is used for testing.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `TestContract` class?\n- The `TestContract` class is used to represent a test contract with various parameters that can be used to test smart contracts.\n\n2. What is the `toComplete()` method used for?\n- The `toComplete()` method is used to convert a `TestContract` instance to a `Complete` instance, which includes additional parameters needed for testing.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `group` parameter in `TestContract` and `Complete`?\n- The `group` parameter is used to specify the group index for the contract, which is needed for testing contracts that are part of a group."
