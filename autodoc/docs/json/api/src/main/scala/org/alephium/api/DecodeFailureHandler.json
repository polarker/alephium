  "summary": "This file contains code for a DecodeFailureHandler trait that is used in the Alephium project. The purpose of this trait is to handle decoding failures that may occur when processing HTTP requests. \n\nThe DecodeFailureHandler trait defines two methods: failureResponse and failureMessage. The failureResponse method takes in a status code, a list of headers, and a message, and returns a ValuedEndpointOutput object. This object contains information about the response that should be sent back to the client in the event of a decoding failure. The failureMessage method takes in a DecodeFailureContext object and returns a string that describes the decoding failure that occurred. \n\nThe myDecodeFailureHandler value is an instance of the DecodeFailureHandler trait that overrides the default decoding failure handling behavior. It sets the response and failureMessage methods to use the failureResponse and failureMessage methods defined in the trait, respectively. It also sets the respond method to return a bad request response if the path shape matches and there is a path error or path invalid error. \n\nThis code is used in the larger Alephium project to handle decoding failures that may occur when processing HTTP requests. By defining a custom DecodeFailureHandler, the project can provide more informative error messages to clients when decoding failures occur. This can help with debugging and improve the overall user experience. \n\nExample usage of this code might look like:\n\n```\nval myEndpoint = endpoint\n  .in(\"myPath\")\n  .in(query[String](\"myQueryParam\"))\n  .out(stringBody)\n  .errorOut(\n    oneOf[ApiError](\n      statusMapping(BadRequest, jsonBody[ApiError.BadRequest])\n    )\n  )\n\nval myLogic: EndpointLogic[String] = { case (myQueryParam, _) =>\n  // some logic that may fail due to decoding errors\n}\n\nval myEndpointWithLogic = myEndpoint\n  .serverLogic(myLogic)\n  .handleDecodeFailure(myDecodeFailureHandler)\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n    \n    This code defines a trait `DecodeFailureHandler` that provides a custom implementation of the `failureResponse` and `failureMessage` methods for handling decoding failures in an API. It also creates an instance of `myDecodeFailureHandler` that can be used as an interceptor in a Tapir server.\n\n2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?\n    \n    This code imports several classes and methods from the `sttp.tapir` and `sttp.model` packages, which are likely part of the Tapir library for building HTTP APIs in Scala. It also references a custom case class `ApiError.BadRequest` defined elsewhere in the `org.alephium.api` package.\n\n3. What license is this code released under?\n    \n    This code is released under the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3 or later. A copy of the license should be included with the library, and can also be found at <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>."
