  "summary": "The code above defines a case class called `ExportFile` which is part of the `org.alephium.api.model` package. The purpose of this class is to represent an exported file with a given filename. \n\nA case class is a special type of class in Scala that is used for modeling immutable data. It automatically generates methods for equality, hashcode, and toString, making it easy to use in functional programming. In this case, the `ExportFile` class has only one field, `filename`, which is a string representing the name of the exported file. \n\nThis class can be used in the larger Alephium project to represent exported files in various contexts. For example, it could be used in a file export feature of the Alephium API, where users can export data to a file with a given name. \n\nHere is an example of how this class could be used:\n\n```scala\nval exportFile = ExportFile(\"my_exported_file.csv\")\nprintln(exportFile.filename) // prints \"my_exported_file.csv\"\n```\n\nIn this example, we create a new `ExportFile` instance with the filename \"my_exported_file.csv\". We then print the filename using the `filename` field of the instance. \n\nOverall, the `ExportFile` class is a simple but useful component of the Alephium project that can be used to represent exported files in a type-safe and immutable way.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `ExportFile` case class?\n   - The `ExportFile` case class is used to represent a file that is being exported, and it contains a `filename` field that specifies the name of the file.\n2. What license is this code released under?\n   - This code is released under the GNU Lesser General Public License, either version 3 of the License, or any later version.\n3. What is the `org.alephium.api.model` package used for?\n   - The `org.alephium.api.model` package contains model classes that are used in the Alephium API. The `ExportFile` case class is one such model class."
