  "summary": "The code above defines a Scala case class called `ApiKey` and an object called `ApiKey` that contains two methods. The `ApiKey` case class has a single field called `value` of type `String`. The `ApiKey` object has two methods: `unsafe` and `from`.\n\nThe `unsafe` method takes a raw string and returns an instance of `ApiKey`. This method is marked as private, which means it can only be accessed within the `ApiKey` object. This method is used to create an instance of `ApiKey` without any validation. It is not recommended to use this method unless you are absolutely sure that the input string is a valid API key.\n\nThe `from` method takes a raw string and returns an `Either` object. If the input string is less than 32 characters long, the method returns a `Left` object with an error message. Otherwise, it returns a `Right` object with an instance of `ApiKey`. This method is used to create an instance of `ApiKey` with validation. It is recommended to use this method to create an instance of `ApiKey`.\n\nThe purpose of this code is to provide a way to create an instance of `ApiKey` with or without validation. This class can be used in the larger project to represent an API key that is used to authenticate requests to the API. By using the `from` method to create an instance of `ApiKey`, the project can ensure that the API key is valid before using it to authenticate requests. This helps to prevent unauthorized access to the API.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nval rawKey = \"myapikey12345678901234567890123456\"\nval apiKey = ApiKey.from(rawKey) match {\n  case Left(error) => println(error)\n  case Right(key) => key\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   This code defines a case class `ApiKey` and provides methods to create instances of it from a raw string.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `final` keyword in `final case class ApiKey`?\n   The `final` keyword indicates that the `ApiKey` class cannot be extended by any other class.\n\n3. What is the difference between the `unsafe` and `from` methods in the `ApiKey` object?\n   The `unsafe` method creates an instance of `ApiKey` without any validation, while the `from` method validates the raw string and returns either an error message or an instance of `ApiKey`."
