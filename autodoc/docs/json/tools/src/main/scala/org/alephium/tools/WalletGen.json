  "summary": "The `WalletGen` object is a tool for generating wallet addresses, public and private keys, and mnemonics for the Alephium cryptocurrency. The tool generates addresses for two different networks, each with a specified number of groups. For each group, the tool generates a unique address, public key, private key, and mnemonic.\n\nThe `gen` method is the core of the tool. It generates a mnemonic, which is a sequence of words that can be used to generate a seed for a hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallet. The seed is then used to generate an extended key using the BIP32 standard. The extended key is then used to generate a private key and a public key. Finally, the public key is used to generate an Alephium address. If the generated address belongs to the specified group, the method returns the address, public key, private key, and mnemonic. Otherwise, the method recursively calls itself until a valid address is generated.\n\nThe `WalletGen` object uses the `gen` method to generate addresses for two different networks: network 1 and network 2. For each network, the tool generates a specified number of groups. For each group, the tool generates a unique address, public key, private key, and mnemonic. The generated addresses, public keys, private keys, and mnemonics are printed to the console.\n\nThe `WalletGen` tool can be used to generate test wallets for the Alephium cryptocurrency. These wallets can be used to test the functionality of the Alephium wallet software without risking real funds. The tool can also be used to generate wallets for development and testing purposes.",
