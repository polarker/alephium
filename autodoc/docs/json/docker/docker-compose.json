  "summary": "This file is a docker-compose configuration file for the Alephium project. It defines three services: alephium, grafana, and prometheus. \n\nThe alephium service is defined with the latest version of the alephium/alephium docker image. It is set to restart unless stopped and has logging options defined. The service exposes ports for external p2p connections and internal clique/apps/network connections. It also has security options set to prevent new privileges. The service has volumes defined to avoid losing data/wallets. The provided file user.conf is a minimal default config to connect the container to the mainnet. \n\nThe grafana service is defined with the latest version of the grafana/grafana docker image. It depends on the prometheus service and exposes port 3000. It has volumes defined for grafana data and provisioning. It also has an env_file defined for monitoring configuration and is set to restart unless stopped. \n\nThe prometheus service is defined with the latest version of the prom/prometheus docker image. It has volumes defined for prometheus configuration and data. It has command options defined for configuration and is set to restart unless stopped. \n\nThis configuration file is used to define the necessary services for running the Alephium project in a docker environment. It allows for easy deployment and management of the project's components. \n\nExample usage: \n\nTo start the services defined in this configuration file, navigate to the directory containing the file and run the following command: \n\n```\ndocker-compose up -d\n```\n\nThis will start the services in detached mode. To stop the services, run the following command: \n\n```\ndocker-compose down\n```",
