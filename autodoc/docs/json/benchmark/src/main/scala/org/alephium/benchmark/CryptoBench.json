  "summary": "The `CryptoBench` class is a benchmarking tool for cryptographic hash functions and digital signature algorithms. It is part of the Alephium project and is used to measure the performance of various cryptographic functions used in the project. \n\nThe class imports several cryptographic functions from the `org.alephium.crypto` package, including `Blake2b`, `Blake3`, `Keccak256`, `SecP256K1`, and `Sha256`. These functions are used to generate cryptographic hashes and digital signatures. \n\nThe `CryptoBench` class defines several benchmark methods, each of which measures the throughput of a specific cryptographic function. The `@Benchmark` annotation indicates that these methods are benchmarks, and the `@BenchmarkMode` and `@OutputTimeUnit` annotations specify the benchmarking mode and output time unit, respectively. \n\nThe `@State` annotation indicates that the `CryptoBench` class is a state object that should be shared across all benchmark threads. The `data` variable is a `ByteString` object that is used as input data for the cryptographic functions. The `privateKey`, `publicKey`, and `signature` variables are used to generate and verify digital signatures using the `SecP256K1` algorithm. \n\nEach benchmark method takes a `Blackhole` object as a parameter. The `Blackhole` object is used to consume the output of the cryptographic function, so that the benchmark measures the performance of the function itself, rather than the performance of any subsequent operations that might be performed on the output. \n\nOverall, the `CryptoBench` class is a useful tool for measuring the performance of cryptographic functions used in the Alephium project. By benchmarking these functions, developers can identify performance bottlenecks and optimize the code for better performance. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```scala\nval bench = new CryptoBench()\nbench.black2b(new Blackhole())\nbench.keccak256(new Blackhole())\nbench.sha256(new Blackhole())\nbench.blake3(new Blackhole())\nbench.secp256k1(new Blackhole())\n```",
