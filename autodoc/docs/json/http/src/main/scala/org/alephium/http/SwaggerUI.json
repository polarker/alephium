  "summary": "The `SwaggerUI` object is a utility for serving a Swagger UI for a given OpenAPI specification. It provides a set of server endpoints that can be used to serve the Swagger UI and the OpenAPI specification file. \n\nThe `apply` method is the main entry point of the object. It takes an OpenAPI specification file as a string, a context path, and a file name for the OpenAPI specification file. It returns a vector of server endpoints that can be used to serve the Swagger UI and the OpenAPI specification file.\n\nThe `swaggerVersion` value is the version of the Swagger UI that is used by the utility. It is extracted from the `pom.properties` file of the `swagger-ui` WebJar.\n\nThe `openapiEndpoint` server endpoint serves the OpenAPI specification file. It takes no input and returns the OpenAPI specification file as a string.\n\nThe `swaggerInitializerJsEndpoint` server endpoint serves the JavaScript file that initializes the Swagger UI. It takes no input and returns the JavaScript file as a string.\n\nThe `resourcesEndpoint` server endpoint serves the static resources required by the Swagger UI. It takes no input and returns the static resources as files.\n\nThe `redirectToSlashEndpoint` server endpoint redirects requests to the context path without a trailing slash to the context path with a trailing slash. It takes query parameters as input and returns a redirect response.\n\nThe `SwaggerUI` object is used in the larger project to serve the Swagger UI and the OpenAPI specification file. It provides a convenient way to serve the Swagger UI without having to write boilerplate code. The server endpoints provided by the `SwaggerUI` object can be used with any HTTP server that supports the Tapir library. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```scala\nimport org.alephium.http.SwaggerUI\n\nval openapiContent = \"openapi: 3.0.0\\ninfo:\\n  title: Example API\\n  version: 1.0.0\\npaths: {}\"\nval serverEndpoints = SwaggerUI(openapiContent)\n\n// Use the server endpoints with an HTTP server\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines an object called `SwaggerUI` that provides a set of server endpoints for serving Swagger UI documentation for an API.\n\n2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?\n- This code uses the `sttp` and `tapir` libraries for defining server endpoints and handling HTTP requests and responses.\n\n3. What is the significance of the `GNU Lesser General Public License` mentioned in the comments?\n- The `GNU Lesser General Public License` is the license under which the `alephium` library is distributed, and this code is part of that library. It allows users to use, modify, and distribute the library under certain conditions."
