  "summary": "The `EndpointSender` class is a part of the Alephium project and is used to send HTTP requests to endpoints. It extends the `BaseEndpoint` class and uses the `SttpClientInterpreter` trait to create requests. The class takes an optional `ApiKey` parameter and an `ExecutionContext` parameter in its constructor.\n\nThe `createRequest` method takes an endpoint, its parameters, and a URI, and returns a request object. The `send` method takes an endpoint, its parameters, and a URI, and returns a future that resolves to the response of the request. The `handleDecodeFailures` method is used to handle decoding errors that may occur when decoding the response of the request.\n\nThe `EndpointSender` class uses the `AsyncHttpClientFutureBackend` to send requests asynchronously. The `startSelfOnce` and `stopSelfOnce` methods are used to start and stop the backend, respectively. The `subServices` method returns an empty `ArraySeq`.\n\nOverall, the `EndpointSender` class provides a convenient way to send HTTP requests to endpoints in the Alephium project. Here is an example of how to use it:\n\n```scala\nimport org.alephium.http.EndpointSender\nimport org.alephium.api.model.ApiKey\nimport org.alephium.api.endpoint.MyEndpoint\n\nimport scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global\n\nval apiKey = ApiKey(\"my-api-key\")\nval endpointSender = new EndpointSender(Some(apiKey))\n\nval params = MyEndpoint.Params(\"param1\", \"param2\")\nval uri = uri\"https://example.com/my-endpoint\"\n\nval response = endpointSender.send(MyEndpoint, params, uri)\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   - This code defines a class `EndpointSender` that creates and sends HTTP requests to a specified endpoint using the STTP library.\n\n2. What external libraries does this code depend on?\n   - This code depends on the STTP, Tapir, and Typesafe logging libraries.\n\n3. What license is this code released under?\n   - This code is released under the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3 or later."
