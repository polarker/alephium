  "summary": "The `JsonRPC` object in the `org.alephium.rpc.model` package provides an implementation of the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification. It defines several case classes and traits that represent JSON-RPC requests, notifications, and responses. \n\nThe `JsonRPC` object contains the following components:\n\n- `Handler`: a type alias for a map of request method names to functions that take a `Request` object and return a `Future` of a `Response` object.\n- `versionKey` and `version`: constants representing the JSON-RPC version key and value, respectively.\n- `paramsCheck`: a private method that checks whether a given JSON value is an object or an array.\n- `versionSet`: a private method that adds the JSON-RPC version key and value to a given JSON object.\n- `Error`: a case class representing a JSON-RPC error response. It contains an error code, message, and optional data field. It also defines several pre-defined error instances for common error cases.\n- `WithId`: a trait representing a JSON-RPC request or notification that has an ID field.\n- `RequestUnsafe`: a case class representing an unsafe JSON-RPC request that has not yet been validated. It contains the JSON-RPC version, method name, parameters, and ID fields. It also defines a `runWith` method that takes a `Handler` and returns a `Future` of a `Response` object.\n- `Request`: a case class representing a validated JSON-RPC request. It contains the method name, parameters, and ID fields. It also defines a `paramsAs` method that attempts to parse the parameters as a given type.\n- `NotificationUnsafe`: a case class representing an unsafe JSON-RPC notification that has not yet been validated. It contains the JSON-RPC version, method name, and optional parameters fields. It also defines an `asNotification` method that attempts to parse the notification as a `Notification` object.\n- `Notification`: a case class representing a validated JSON-RPC notification. It contains the method name and parameters fields.\n- `Response`: a sealed trait representing a JSON-RPC response. It defines two case classes: `Success` and `Failure`. `Success` represents a successful response with a result field, while `Failure` represents a failed response with an error field. It also defines several factory methods for creating `Success` and `Failure` objects.\n\nOverall, the `JsonRPC` object provides a flexible and extensible implementation of the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification that can be used to handle JSON-RPC requests and notifications in a Scala application. For example, a developer could define a `Handler` that maps method names to functions that perform specific actions, such as querying a database or calling an external API. The `JsonRPC` object could then be used to parse incoming JSON-RPC requests and notifications, validate them, and execute the appropriate handler function. The resulting `Response` object could then be serialized back to JSON and sent back to the client.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code implements a JSON-RPC server and client for the Alephium project.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `version` and `versionKey` variables?\n- `version` is the JSON-RPC version used by this implementation, and `versionKey` is the key used to identify the version in JSON-RPC messages.\n- These variables are used throughout the code to ensure that the implementation is compatible with the JSON-RPC specification.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `paramsCheck` and `versionSet` functions?\n- `paramsCheck` checks whether a given JSON value is a valid JSON-RPC parameter (i.e. an object or an array).\n- `versionSet` adds the JSON-RPC version to a given JSON value if it is an object.\n- These functions are used to validate and modify JSON-RPC messages before they are sent or received."
