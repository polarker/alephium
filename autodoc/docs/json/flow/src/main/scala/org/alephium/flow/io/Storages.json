  "summary": "The `Storages` object provides a set of storage-related functionalities for the Alephium project. It defines a set of postfixes that are used to identify different types of data stored in the RocksDB database. It also provides a set of methods to create and manage different types of storage objects.\n\nThe `createUnsafe` method creates a set of storage objects that are used to store different types of data. These objects include `BlockRockDBStorage`, `BlockHeaderRockDBStorage`, `BlockStateRockDBStorage`, `TxRocksDBStorage`, `NodeStateRockDBStorage`, `RocksDBKeyValueStorage`, `LogStorage`, `WorldStateRockDBStorage`, `PendingTxRocksDBStorage`, `ReadyTxRocksDBStorage`, and `BrokerRocksDBStorage`. These objects are created using the `createRocksDBUnsafe` method, which creates a RocksDB database at the specified location.\n\nThe `Storages` class is a container for all the storage objects created by the `createUnsafe` method. It provides a unified interface to access all the storage objects. It also provides methods to close and destroy the storage objects.\n\nOverall, the `Storages` object and class provide a convenient way to manage different types of storage objects used in the Alephium project. These storage objects are used to store different types of data, such as blocks, transactions, and world state. The `Storages` object and class can be used to create, manage, and access these storage objects in a unified way.",
