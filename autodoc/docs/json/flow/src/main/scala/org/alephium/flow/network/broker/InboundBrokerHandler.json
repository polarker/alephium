  "summary": "The code defines a trait called `InboundBrokerHandler` which extends `BrokerHandler`. This trait is used to handle incoming broker connections in the Alephium network. \n\nThe `InboundBrokerHandler` trait has several abstract methods and values that need to be implemented by any class that extends it. These include `selfCliqueInfo`, `networkSetting`, `connection`, and `cliqueManager`. \n\nThe `selfCliqueInfo` method returns information about the local clique, which is a group of nodes that work together to validate transactions and maintain the blockchain. The `networkSetting` method returns the network settings for the Alephium network, such as the retry timeout and ping frequency. The `connection` method returns the Akka actor reference for the incoming connection, and the `cliqueManager` method returns the Akka actor reference for the clique manager.\n\nThe `InboundBrokerHandler` trait also overrides several methods from the `BrokerHandler` trait. For example, the `handShakeDuration` method returns the retry timeout from the network settings, and the `handShakeMessage` method returns a `Hello` message containing information about the local clique. \n\nOverall, the `InboundBrokerHandler` trait provides a framework for handling incoming broker connections in the Alephium network. By implementing the abstract methods and values, developers can create custom classes that handle incoming connections in a way that is specific to their needs. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```scala\nclass MyInboundBrokerHandler extends InboundBrokerHandler {\n  val selfCliqueInfo: CliqueInfo = ???\n  implicit val networkSetting: NetworkSetting = ???\n  val connection: ActorRefT[Tcp.Command] = ???\n  val cliqueManager: ActorRefT[CliqueManager.Command] = ???\n  \n  // Implement any additional methods or values as needed\n  \n  // Override any methods from BrokerHandler as needed\n  \n}\n```",
