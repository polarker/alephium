  "summary": "The code defines a set of utility functions that can be used throughout the Alephium project. These functions are designed to help with displaying and formatting various types of data used in the project.\n\nThe `showDigest` function takes a vector of `RandomBytes` objects and returns a string representation of the digests. If the vector is empty, it returns an empty string. Otherwise, it returns a string containing the short hexadecimal representation of the first and last digests in the vector.\n\nThe `showTxs` function takes a vector of `TransactionTemplate` objects and returns a string representation of the transaction IDs. If the vector is empty, it returns an empty string. Otherwise, it returns a string containing the short hexadecimal representation of the first and last transaction IDs in the vector.\n\nThe `showFlow` function takes a vector of vectors of `RandomBytes` objects and returns a string representation of the flow digests. It does this by mapping the `showDigest` function over each vector in the input vector and then joining the resulting strings with commas.\n\nThe `showDataDigest` function takes a vector of `FlowData` objects and returns a string representation of the data digests. If the vector is empty, it returns an empty string. Otherwise, it returns a string containing the short hexadecimal representation of the first and last data digests in the vector.\n\nThe `showChainIndexedDigest` function takes a vector of pairs of `ChainIndex` and vectors of `TransactionId` objects and returns a string representation of the chain indexed digests. It does this by mapping the `showDigest` function over each vector of transaction IDs in the input vector and then joining the resulting strings with arrows that point from the corresponding `ChainIndex` to the resulting string.\n\nThe `unsafe` function takes an `IOResult` object and returns the result if it is a `Right` value, or throws the error if it is a `Left` value. This function is used to handle errors that may occur when reading or writing data to disk.\n\nOverall, these utility functions are designed to make it easier to work with and display various types of data used in the Alephium project. They can be used throughout the project to help with debugging, testing, and other tasks.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Utils` object?\n- The `Utils` object contains several utility functions for displaying data related to the Alephium project.\n\n2. What is the `showChainIndexedDigest` function used for?\n- The `showChainIndexedDigest` function takes in a vector of tuples containing a `ChainIndex` and a vector of `TransactionId`s, and returns a string representation of the data in the format of `ChainIndex -> [ TransactionId1 .. TransactionIdN ]`.\n\n3. What license is this code released under?\n- This code is released under the GNU Lesser General Public License, either version 3 of the License, or any later version."
