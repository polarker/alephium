  "summary": "This file contains code for a BlockStorage trait and a BlockRockDBStorage class that implements the trait. The purpose of this code is to provide a way to store and retrieve blocks in a RocksDB database. \n\nThe BlockStorage trait extends the KeyValueStorage trait and adds two methods for putting blocks into the database. The put method takes a Block object and stores it in the database using its hash as the key. The putUnsafe method does the same thing but does not return an IOResult object. \n\nThe BlockRockDBStorage class extends the RocksDBKeyValueStorage class and implements the BlockStorage trait. It takes a RocksDBSource object, a ColumnFamily object, a WriteOptions object, and a ReadOptions object as parameters. The constructor then calls the constructor of the RocksDBKeyValueStorage class with these parameters. \n\nThe BlockRockDBStorage class also overrides the remove and removeUnsafe methods of the KeyValueStorage trait, but these methods are not implemented and simply throw an exception. \n\nThis code can be used in the larger project to store and retrieve blocks in a RocksDB database. The BlockRockDBStorage class can be instantiated with the appropriate parameters and then used to store and retrieve blocks. For example, to store a block, the put method can be called with the block as a parameter:\n\n```\nval blockStorage = BlockRockDBStorage(...)\nval block = Block(...)\nblockStorage.put(block)\n```\n\nTo retrieve a block, the get method of the RocksDBKeyValueStorage class can be called with the block's hash as a parameter:\n\n```\nval blockStorage = BlockRockDBStorage(...)\nval blockHash = BlockHash(...)\nval maybeBlock = blockStorage.get(blockHash)\n```\n\nOverall, this code provides a simple and efficient way to store and retrieve blocks in a RocksDB database.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `BlockStorage` trait?\n   - The `BlockStorage` trait is a key-value storage interface for storing and retrieving `Block` objects using their `BlockHash`.\n2. What is the `BlockRockDBStorage` object and how is it used?\n   - The `BlockRockDBStorage` object is a companion object for creating instances of `BlockRockDBStorage`, which is a RocksDB-based implementation of the `BlockStorage` trait. It takes in a `RocksDBSource`, a `ColumnFamily`, and `ReadOptions` and `WriteOptions` objects to create a new instance.\n3. What methods are implemented in the `BlockRockDBStorage` class?\n   - The `BlockRockDBStorage` class implements the `remove` and `removeUnsafe` methods from the `KeyValueStorage` trait, and the `put` and `putUnsafe` methods from the `BlockStorage` trait. The implementation of `remove` and `removeUnsafe` is not provided and is left to be implemented by the user."
