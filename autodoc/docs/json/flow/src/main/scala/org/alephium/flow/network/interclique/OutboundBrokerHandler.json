  "summary": "The code defines a class called `OutboundBrokerHandler` and an object called `OutboundBrokerHandler` in the `org.alephium.flow.network.interclique` package. The purpose of this code is to handle outbound broker connections between different cliques in the Alephium network. \n\nThe `OutboundBrokerHandler` class extends `BaseOutboundBrokerHandler` and implements the `BrokerHandler` trait. It takes in several parameters including `selfCliqueInfo`, `expectedRemoteBroker`, `blockflow`, `allHandlers`, `cliqueManager`, and `blockFlowSynchronizer`. These parameters are used to create an instance of the `OutboundBrokerHandler` class. \n\nThe `OutboundBrokerHandler` object contains a `props` method that creates a new instance of the `OutboundBrokerHandler` class with the given parameters. \n\nThe `OutboundBrokerHandler` class overrides the `handleHandshakeInfo` method from the `BaseOutboundBrokerHandler` class. This method is called when a handshake message is received from the remote broker. The method checks if the `remoteBrokerInfo` matches the `expectedRemoteBroker`. If it does, the `super.handleHandshakeInfo` method is called to handle the handshake message. If it does not match, the method logs a debug message and stops the actor. \n\nOverall, this code is an important part of the Alephium network's interclique communication system. It ensures that outbound broker connections are properly authenticated and handled. \n\nExample usage:\n```\nval outboundBrokerHandler = system.actorOf(\n  OutboundBrokerHandler.props(\n    selfCliqueInfo,\n    remoteBroker,\n    blockflow,\n    allHandlers,\n    cliqueManager,\n    blockFlowSynchronizer\n  )\n)\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code file?\n    \n    This code file contains the implementation of an outbound broker handler for the Alephium project's interclique network.\n\n2. What is the role of the `OutboundBrokerHandler` class?\n    \n    The `OutboundBrokerHandler` class is responsible for handling outbound broker connections and ensuring that the remote broker has the expected broker info.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `handleHandshakeInfo` method?\n    \n    The `handleHandshakeInfo` method is used to handle the handshake information received from the remote broker and ensure that it matches the expected broker info. If it does not match, the handler is stopped."
