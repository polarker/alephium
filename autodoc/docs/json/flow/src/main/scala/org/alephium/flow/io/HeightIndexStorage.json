  "summary": "The code defines a class called `HeightIndexStorage` that extends `RocksDBKeyValueStorage`. This class is used to store a mapping between block heights and their corresponding block hashes. The purpose of this class is to provide a way to efficiently look up block hashes by their height.\n\nThe `HeightIndexStorage` class takes in several parameters in its constructor. The `chainIndex` parameter is an instance of the `ChainIndex` class, which represents a range of block heights. The `storage` parameter is an instance of `RocksDBSource`, which is a wrapper around the RocksDB key-value store. The `cf` parameter is a `ColumnFamily` object that represents the column family in which the data will be stored. The `writeOptions` and `readOptions` parameters are instances of `WriteOptions` and `ReadOptions`, respectively, which are used to configure the behavior of the RocksDB store.\n\nThe `HeightIndexStorage` class overrides the `storageKey` method to generate the key that will be used to store the block hash in the RocksDB store. The key is generated by concatenating the block height with a postfix that is specific to the `HeightIndexStorage` class. The postfix is generated using the `chainIndex` parameter, which specifies the range of block heights that this instance of `HeightIndexStorage` is responsible for.\n\nThe `HeightIndexStorage` class also defines an implicit `Serde` for `AVector[BlockHash]`, which is used to serialize and deserialize the block hashes that are stored in the RocksDB store.\n\nOverall, the `HeightIndexStorage` class provides a way to efficiently store and look up block hashes by their height. This is useful for various parts of the Alephium project that need to look up block hashes by their height, such as the block explorer or the consensus algorithm. Here is an example of how the `HeightIndexStorage` class might be used:\n\n```\nval chainIndex = ChainIndex(0, 1000)\nval storage = new RocksDBSource(\"/path/to/rocksdb\")\nval cf = storage.createColumnFamily(\"height_index\")\nval writeOptions = new WriteOptions()\nval readOptions = new ReadOptions()\nval heightIndexStorage = new HeightIndexStorage(chainIndex, storage, cf, writeOptions, readOptions)\n\n// Store a block hash at height 500\nval blockHash = BlockHash.fromBytes(Bytes.from(Array.fill(32)(0)))\nheightIndexStorage.put(500, AVector(blockHash))\n\n// Look up the block hash at height 500\nval retrievedBlockHashes = heightIndexStorage.get(500)\nassert(retrievedBlockHashes == Some(AVector(blockHash)))\n```",
