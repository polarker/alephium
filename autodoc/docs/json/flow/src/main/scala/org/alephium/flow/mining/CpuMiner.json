  "summary": "The `CpuMiner` class is a component of the Alephium project that is responsible for mining new blocks on the blockchain. It is designed to run on a CPU and is implemented as an Akka actor. The purpose of this class is to handle mining tasks and communicate with other components of the system to validate and publish new blocks.\n\nThe `CpuMiner` class has a constructor that takes an instance of `AllHandlers`, which is a collection of handlers for different components of the system. It also takes two implicit parameters, `BrokerConfig` and `MiningSetting`, which are used to configure the mining process.\n\nThe `CpuMiner` class has several methods that are used to handle mining tasks. The `subscribeForTasks` method is used to subscribe to new mining tasks, while the `unsubscribeTasks` method is used to unsubscribe from mining tasks. The `publishNewBlock` method is used to publish a new block to the blockchain.\n\nThe `CpuMiner` class also has a `receive` method that is used to handle messages sent to the actor. The `handleMining` method is used to handle mining tasks, while the `handleMiningTasks` method is used to handle messages related to mining tasks.\n\nThe `updateAndStartTasks` method is used to update the mining tasks and start new tasks. It takes an `IndexedSeq` of `IndexedSeq` of `BlockFlowTemplate` objects as input, which represent the mining tasks. The method updates the `pendingTasks` array with the new tasks and starts new tasks.\n\nThe `props` method is used to create a new instance of the `CpuMiner` class. It takes a `Node` object as input and returns a `Props` object that can be used to create a new instance of the `CpuMiner` class. It also takes an implicit `AlephiumConfig` object, which is used to configure the mining process.\n\nOverall, the `CpuMiner` class is an important component of the Alephium project that is responsible for mining new blocks on the blockchain. It communicates with other components of the system to validate and publish new blocks, and is designed to run on a CPU.",
