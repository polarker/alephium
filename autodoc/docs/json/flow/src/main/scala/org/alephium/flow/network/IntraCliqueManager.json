  "summary": "The `IntraCliqueManager` class is responsible for managing the intra-clique communication between brokers in the Alephium network. The purpose of this code is to ensure that all brokers within a clique are connected and synced with each other. \n\nThe class is implemented as an Akka actor, and it receives messages in the form of commands. The `props` method is used to create a new instance of the actor with the given parameters. The `Command` trait defines the messages that the actor can receive. The `HandShaked` message is sent when a broker has successfully completed the handshake process with another broker. The `Ready` message is sent when all brokers in the clique have connected and synced with each other. The `BroadCastBlock` message is sent when a new block is added to the blockchain and needs to be broadcasted to all other brokers in the clique. The `BroadCastTx` message is sent when a new transaction is added to the blockchain and needs to be broadcasted to all other brokers in the clique.\n\nThe `preStart` method is called when the actor is started. It connects to all other brokers in the clique and waits for them to complete the handshake process. If there is only one broker in the clique, it sends the `Ready` message to the `CliqueManager` actor and subscribes to the `BroadCastBlock` and `BroadCastTx` events. If there are multiple brokers in the clique, it waits for all of them to complete the handshake process before sending the `Ready` message.\n\nThe `awaitBrokers` method is called when the actor is waiting for brokers to complete the handshake process. It handles incoming connections from other brokers and creates new `InboundBrokerHandler` actors to handle them. It also handles the `HandShaked` message and adds the new broker to the list of connected brokers. If all brokers have connected, it calls the `checkAllSynced` method.\n\nThe `checkAllSynced` method is called when all brokers have connected. It sends the `Ready` message to the `CliqueManager` actor and subscribes to the `BroadCastBlock` and `BroadCastTx` events. It also switches the actor's behavior to the `handle` method.\n\nThe `handle` method is called when all brokers have connected and synced. It handles the `BroadCastBlock` and `BroadCastTx` messages by broadcasting them to all other brokers in the clique. It also handles the `Terminated` message and removes the terminated actor from the list of connected brokers.\n\nOverall, the `IntraCliqueManager` class plays a crucial role in ensuring that all brokers within a clique are connected and synced with each other. This is essential for maintaining the consistency and integrity of the blockchain.",
  "questions": "1.
