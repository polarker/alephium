  "summary": "The code defines a trait called `DownloadTracker` that is used to track the download status of blocks in the Alephium network. The trait extends the `BaseActor` class, which provides basic actor functionality such as message handling and lifecycle management.\n\nThe `DownloadTracker` trait defines several methods and a mutable `HashMap` called `syncing` that keeps track of the blocks that are currently being downloaded. The `blockflow` method is an abstract method that must be implemented by any class that extends the `DownloadTracker` trait. This method returns an instance of the `BlockFlow` class, which is used to manage the blockchain data.\n\nThe `needToDownload` method takes a `BlockHash` as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the block needs to be downloaded. It checks whether the block is already in the `syncing` map or whether it is already present in the `blockflow`.\n\nThe `download` method takes a vector of vectors of `BlockHash`es as input and downloads the blocks that are not already being downloaded or present in the `blockflow`. It adds the blocks to the `syncing` map and sends a message to the `BrokerHandler` to download the blocks.\n\nThe `finalized` method takes a `BlockHash` as input and removes it from the `syncing` map once the block has been downloaded.\n\nThe `cleanupSyncing` method removes blocks from the `syncing` map that have been in the map for longer than a specified duration. It takes a `Duration` as input and removes any blocks that have been in the map for longer than the specified duration.\n\nOverall, the `DownloadTracker` trait provides functionality for tracking the download status of blocks in the Alephium network. It is used by other classes in the project to manage the download of blocks and ensure that blocks are not downloaded multiple times. For example, the `BrokerHandler` class uses the `DownloadTracker` trait to manage the download of blocks from other nodes in the network.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `DownloadTracker` trait?\n- The `DownloadTracker` trait is used to track and manage the downloading of blocks in the Alephium project's network synchronization process.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `syncing` mutable HashMap?\n- The `syncing` mutable HashMap is used to keep track of blocks that are currently being synchronized in the network. It maps block hashes to timestamps indicating when the synchronization process began.\n\n3. What does the `cleanupSyncing` method do?\n- The `cleanupSyncing` method removes block hashes from the `syncing` HashMap that have been synchronized for longer than a specified duration. This is done to prevent the HashMap from growing too large and to ensure that the synchronization process remains efficient."
