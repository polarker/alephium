  "summary": "The code defines an event bus that can be used to publish and subscribe to events within the Alephium project. The event bus is implemented as an Akka actor and provides a simple API for subscribing to and unsubscribing from events, as well as listing the current subscribers.\n\nThe `EventBus` object defines a set of messages that can be sent to the event bus, including `Subscribe`, `Unsubscribe`, and `ListSubscribers`. These messages are used to manage the subscribers to the event bus.\n\nThe `EventBus` class extends the `BaseActor` class and implements the `Subscriber` trait. The `BaseActor` class provides a basic implementation of an Akka actor, while the `Subscriber` trait defines a simple interface for subscribing to events.\n\nThe `EventBus` class maintains a set of subscribers using a mutable `HashSet` and provides a `receive` method that handles incoming messages. When an `Event` message is received, the event is broadcast to all subscribers. When a `Subscribe` message is received, the sender is added to the set of subscribers if they are not already subscribed. When an `Unsubscribe` message is received, the sender is removed from the set of subscribers if they are subscribed. When a `ListSubscribers` message is received, the current set of subscribers is returned to the sender as a `Subscribers` message.\n\nThis event bus can be used throughout the Alephium project to allow different components to communicate with each other using a simple publish-subscribe model. For example, a component that generates new blocks could publish a `BlockGenerated` event, which would be received by other components that need to be notified of new blocks. Similarly, a component that needs to be notified of changes to the network could subscribe to a `NetworkChanged` event. Overall, the event bus provides a flexible and extensible way for different components to communicate with each other within the Alephium project.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   This code defines an event bus implementation in Scala using Akka actors, allowing subscribers to receive events and unsubscribe from them.\n\n2. What is the license for this code?\n   This code is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License version 3 or later.\n\n3. What is the data structure used to store subscribers?\n   The code uses a mutable HashSet to store the subscribers, allowing for efficient addition and removal of subscribers."
