  "summary": "The `I256` class in the `org.alephium.util` package provides a way to represent signed 256-bit integers in Scala. It is implemented as a wrapper around `java.math.BigInteger` and provides a number of arithmetic operations that can be performed on `I256` instances. \n\nThe class provides methods to check if an `I256` instance is zero, non-negative, or negative. It also provides methods to negate, add, subtract, multiply, divide, and take the modulus of two `I256` instances. These methods are implemented both as \"unsafe\" methods that assume the result is valid and throw an exception if it is not, and as \"safe\" methods that return an `Option[I256]` that is `None` if the result is invalid. \n\nThe `I256` class also provides a `pow` method that raises an `I256` instance to the power of a `U256` instance. This method returns an `Option[I256]` that is `None` if the result is invalid. \n\nThe `I256` class provides methods to convert an `I256` instance to a `ByteString`, a `BigInteger`, a `Byte`, or an `Int`. It also provides a `toString` method that returns a string representation of the `I256` instance. \n\nThe `I256` companion object provides a number of constants, including `Zero`, `One`, `Two`, `NegOne`, `MaxValue`, and `MinValue`, which represent common `I256` values. It also provides methods to create `I256` instances from `ByteString`, `BigInteger`, `Int`, and `Long` values, as well as from `U256` instances. \n\nOverall, the `I256` class provides a convenient way to work with signed 256-bit integers in Scala, and is likely used extensively throughout the Alephium project. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```scala\nimport org.alephium.util.I256\n\nval a = I256.from(42).get\nval b = I256.from(-10).get\n\nval sum = a.add(b).get\nval product = a.mul(b).get\nval quotient = a.div(b)\n\nprintln(s\"sum: $sum, product: $product, quotient: $quotient\")\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `I256` class and what operations can be performed on it?\n- The `I256` class represents a signed 256-bit integer and supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo. It also has methods for checking if the value is zero or negative, and for converting to different data types.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `validate` method and where is it used?\n- The `validate` method checks if a given `BigInteger` value can be safely converted to an `I256` instance without losing precision or exceeding the maximum bit length. It is used in the `unsafe` factory methods to ensure that only valid values are created.\n\n3. What are the constants defined in the `I256` companion object and how are they used?\n- The `I256` companion object defines several constants such as `Zero`, `One`, `MaxValue`, and `MinValue` that represent common values of `I256`. They are used to avoid creating new instances of `I256` for frequently used values, and to provide a convenient way to access them."
