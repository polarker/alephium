  "summary": "The code above defines a custom exception class called `AppException`. This class is located in the `org.alephium.util` package. \n\nAn exception is a runtime error that occurs during the execution of a program. When an exception is thrown, the program stops executing and the exception is propagated up the call stack until it is caught by an exception handler. \n\nIn this case, the `AppException` class is used to represent exceptions that are specific to the Alephium project. The class takes a single argument, `message`, which is a string that describes the exception. \n\nBy defining a custom exception class, the Alephium project can provide more specific error messages to users and developers. For example, if a function in the project encounters an error that is related to a specific module or component, it can throw an instance of `AppException` with a message that describes the error in detail. \n\nHere is an example of how the `AppException` class might be used in the Alephium project:\n\n```\nimport org.alephium.util.AppException\n\ndef divide(a: Int, b: Int): Int = {\n  if (b == 0) {\n    throw new AppException(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n  }\n  a / b\n}\n\ntry {\n  val result = divide(10, 0)\n} catch {\n  case e: AppException => println(e.getMessage())\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `divide` function checks if the second argument is zero. If it is, the function throws an instance of `AppException` with the message \"Cannot divide by zero\". The exception is caught by a `try`/`catch` block, which prints the error message to the console. \n\nOverall, the `AppException` class is a useful tool for handling errors in the Alephium project. By providing more specific error messages, the project can make it easier for developers to debug issues and for users to understand what went wrong.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `alephium` project?\n- The `alephium` project is not described in this code file, so it is unclear what its purpose is.\n\n2. What is the `AppException` class used for?\n- The `AppException` class is used to define a custom exception that can be thrown with a specified error message.\n\n3. What license is this code released under?\n- This code is released under the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3 or later."
