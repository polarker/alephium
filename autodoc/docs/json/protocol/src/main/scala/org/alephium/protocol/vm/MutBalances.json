  "summary": "The code defines a class called `MutBalances` which represents a mutable collection of balances for different lockup scripts. Each lockup script has a corresponding `MutBalancesPerLockup` object which contains the balance of ALPH (the native token of the Alephium blockchain) and other tokens for that lockup script. The purpose of this class is to keep track of the balances of different tokens for different lockup scripts during the execution of smart contracts on the Alephium blockchain.\n\nThe `MutBalances` class provides methods to add and subtract balances of ALPH and other tokens for a given lockup script, as well as methods to retrieve the balances of a lockup script and convert the balances to transaction outputs. The class also provides methods to merge balances from another `MutBalances` object and to create a new `MutBalancesPerLockup` object for a new contract.\n\nThe `from` method is a factory method that creates a new `MutBalances` object from a vector of input and output `AssetOutput` objects. The input `AssetOutput` objects are used to add balances to the corresponding lockup scripts, while the output `AssetOutput` objects are used to subtract balances from the corresponding lockup scripts.\n\nOverall, the `MutBalances` class is an important component of the Alephium blockchain's smart contract execution engine, as it allows smart contracts to keep track of the balances of different tokens for different lockup scripts.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `MutBalances` class?\n- The `MutBalances` class represents mutable balances for a lockup script, which can be updated by adding or subtracting amounts of Alph or tokens.\n\n2. What is the `useForNewContract` method used for?\n- The `useForNewContract` method is used to retrieve the total balances of all lockup scripts in the `MutBalances` instance and clear it, in order to use the balances for a new contract.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `from` method in the `MutBalances` companion object?\n- The `from` method is used to create a `MutBalances` instance from a vector of asset outputs, by adding the amounts of Alph and tokens for each lockup script in the inputs and subtracting them for the outputs."
