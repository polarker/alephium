  "summary": "This file contains the implementation of the `Transaction` and `TransactionTemplate` classes, which represent transactions in the Alephium blockchain. \n\nThe `Transaction` class is a sealed trait that defines the basic structure of a transaction, including its inputs, outputs, and signatures. It also provides methods for computing the transaction's ID, gas fee, and asset output references. The `Transaction` class is immutable and can be constructed from various inputs and outputs, including coinbase transactions, contract transactions, and regular transactions. \n\nThe `TransactionTemplate` class is a simplified version of the `Transaction` class that only includes the unsigned transaction and its input signatures. It is used to represent transactions that have not yet been signed by all parties involved. \n\nThe file also includes several utility methods for constructing transactions, including `from`, `coinbase`, and `genesis`. These methods take various inputs and outputs and return a fully constructed transaction. \n\nOverall, this file plays a critical role in the Alephium blockchain by defining the structure and behavior of transactions. It is used extensively throughout the codebase to create, validate, and process transactions.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `TransactionAbstract` trait and what methods does it define?\n- The `TransactionAbstract` trait defines methods that are common to both `Transaction` and `TransactionTemplate` classes, such as `id`, `inputsLength`, `outputsLength`, `getOutput`, and `assetOutputRefs`.\n- It also defines abstract methods `unsigned`, `inputSignatures`, and `scriptSignatures` that must be implemented by its subclasses.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `coinbase` method and what parameters does it take?\n- The `coinbase` method generates a coinbase transaction, which is a special type of transaction that creates new coins and rewards the miner who successfully mines a block.\n- It takes parameters such as `chainIndex`, `gasFee`, `lockupScript`, `minerData`, `target`, and `blockTs` to calculate the mining reward, create the output, and set the lockup period and output data.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `genesis` method and what parameters does it take?\n- The `genesis` method generates a genesis transaction, which is a special type of transaction that creates the initial distribution of coins in a blockchain.\n- It takes parameters such as `balances` and `noPreMineProof` to create the initial outputs with lockup scripts, values, and durations, and optionally include a proof of no pre-mine for the first output."
