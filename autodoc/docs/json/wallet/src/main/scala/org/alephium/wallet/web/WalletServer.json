  "summary": "This file contains the implementation of a web server for the Alephium wallet. The server exposes a set of endpoints that allow users to interact with their wallets, such as creating a new wallet, transferring funds, and getting wallet information. The server is built using the Vert.x web framework and uses the Tapir library for defining the API endpoints.\n\nThe `WalletServer` class is the main entry point for the server. It takes a `WalletService` instance, which provides the business logic for the wallet operations, and a few other parameters such as the maximum age of cached block data and an optional API key for authentication. The class extends `WalletEndpointsLogic`, which defines the actual endpoint implementations, and `VertxFutureServerInterpreter`, which provides the integration with Vert.x.\n\nThe `routes` field is a vector of functions that take a `Router` instance and return a `Route`. Each function corresponds to an endpoint and is defined in `WalletEndpointsLogic`. The `map` method is used to apply the `route` function to each element of the vector, resulting in a vector of `Route` instances. These routes are then combined into a single router using the `Router` class.\n\nThe `docsRoute` field is a route that serves the Swagger UI documentation for the API. It uses the `openApiJson` method from `OpenAPIWriters` to generate the OpenAPI specification for the API, which is then passed to the `SwaggerUI` class to generate the HTML documentation.\n\nThe `toApiError` method in the `WalletServer` companion object is a utility method for converting `WalletError` instances to `ApiError` instances, which are used to generate error responses for the API. The method matches on the type of the `WalletError` and returns an appropriate `ApiError` instance. For example, if the error is an `InvalidWalletName`, it returns a `BadRequest` error with the error message.\n\nOverall, this file provides the implementation of a web server that exposes a set of endpoints for interacting with Alephium wallets. The server is built using the Vert.x web framework and uses the Tapir library for defining the API endpoints. The `WalletServer` class is the main entry point for the server, and the `routes` field defines the actual endpoint implementations. The `toApiError` method is a utility method for generating error responses.",
