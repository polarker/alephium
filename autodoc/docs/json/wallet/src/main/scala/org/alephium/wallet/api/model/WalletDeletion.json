  "summary": "The code above defines a case class called `WalletDeletion` that takes a single parameter `password` of type `String`. This case class is located in the `org.alephium.wallet.api.model` package.\n\nThe purpose of this code is to provide a data model for deleting a wallet in the Alephium project. The `WalletDeletion` case class is used to encapsulate the password required to delete a wallet. This password is passed as a parameter to the `WalletDeletion` case class.\n\nThis code is likely used in conjunction with other code in the Alephium project to provide functionality for deleting a wallet. For example, a method in another class may take an instance of `WalletDeletion` as a parameter and use the password contained within it to delete the corresponding wallet.\n\nHere is an example of how this code may be used in the larger project:\n\n```scala\nimport org.alephium.wallet.api.model.WalletDeletion\n\nclass WalletManager {\n  def deleteWallet(walletDeletion: WalletDeletion): Unit = {\n    // code to delete wallet using password from walletDeletion\n  }\n}\n\nval password = \"myPassword\"\nval walletDeletion = WalletDeletion(password)\nval walletManager = new WalletManager()\nwalletManager.deleteWallet(walletDeletion)\n```\n\nIn the example above, an instance of `WalletDeletion` is created with the password \"myPassword\". This instance is then passed as a parameter to the `deleteWallet` method of a `WalletManager` instance. The `deleteWallet` method would then use the password contained within the `walletDeletion` parameter to delete the corresponding wallet.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `WalletDeletion` case class?\n- The `WalletDeletion` case class is used to represent a request to delete a wallet, and it contains a password field.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `final` keyword before the `case class` declaration?\n- The `final` keyword indicates that the `WalletDeletion` case class cannot be extended or subclassed.\n\n3. What is the intended use of this code within the `alephium` project?\n- This code is part of the `org.alephium.wallet.api.model` package, and it likely serves as a model for handling wallet deletion requests within the Alephium wallet API."
