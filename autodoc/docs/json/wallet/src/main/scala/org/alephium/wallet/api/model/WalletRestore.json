  "summary": "The code above defines two case classes, `WalletRestore` and `WalletRestoreResult`, which are used in the Alephium wallet API. \n\n`WalletRestore` is a case class that represents the information needed to restore a wallet. It contains the following fields:\n- `password`: a string representing the password for the wallet.\n- `mnemonic`: an instance of the `Mnemonic` class, which represents the mnemonic phrase used to generate the wallet's private key.\n- `walletName`: a string representing the name of the wallet to be restored.\n- `isMiner`: an optional boolean value indicating whether the restored wallet is a miner wallet or not.\n- `mnemonicPassphrase`: an optional string representing the passphrase used to generate the mnemonic phrase.\n\n`WalletRestoreResult` is a case class that represents the result of a wallet restoration operation. It contains a single field:\n- `walletName`: a string representing the name of the restored wallet.\n\nThese case classes are used in the Alephium wallet API to allow users to restore their wallets using a mnemonic phrase. The `WalletRestore` case class is used to collect the necessary information from the user, while the `WalletRestoreResult` case class is used to return the name of the restored wallet to the user.\n\nHere is an example of how these case classes might be used in the context of the Alephium wallet API:\n\n```scala\nimport org.alephium.wallet.api.model._\n\n// Collect the necessary information from the user to restore a wallet\nval restoreInfo = WalletRestore(\n  password = \"myPassword\",\n  mnemonic = Mnemonic(\"abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon about\"),\n  walletName = \"myWallet\",\n  isMiner = Some(false),\n  mnemonicPassphrase = None\n)\n\n// Restore the wallet using the collected information\nval restoredWallet = Wallet.restore(restoreInfo)\n\n// Return the name of the restored wallet to the user\nval result = WalletRestoreResult(restoredWallet.name)\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `WalletRestore` case class?\n   - The `WalletRestore` case class is used to represent the data needed to restore a wallet, including the password, mnemonic, wallet name, and optional flags for whether the wallet is a miner and whether a mnemonic passphrase is used.\n2. What is the `WalletRestoreResult` case class used for?\n   - The `WalletRestoreResult` case class is used to represent the result of a wallet restore operation, containing the name of the restored wallet.\n3. What is the `Mnemonic` class imported from `org.alephium.crypto.wallet` used for?\n   - The `Mnemonic` class is likely used to handle the generation and manipulation of mnemonic phrases, which are used as a seed to generate a wallet's private keys."
