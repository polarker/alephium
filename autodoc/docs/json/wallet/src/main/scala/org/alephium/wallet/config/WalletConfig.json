  "summary": "This file contains the implementation of the `WalletConfig` class and its nested `BlockFlow` class. The purpose of this code is to provide a configuration object for the Alephium wallet. \n\nThe `WalletConfig` class has five fields: `port`, `secretDir`, `lockingTimeout`, `apiKey`, and `blockflow`. The `port` field is an optional integer that specifies the port number on which the wallet should listen for incoming connections. The `secretDir` field is a `java.nio.file.Path` object that specifies the directory where the wallet should store its secret keys. The `lockingTimeout` field is a `org.alephium.util.Duration` object that specifies the maximum amount of time the wallet should wait for a lock to be released. The `apiKey` field is an optional `org.alephium.api.model.ApiKey` object that specifies the API key to use for authentication. Finally, the `blockflow` field is a `WalletConfig.BlockFlow` object that specifies the configuration for the BlockFlow service.\n\nThe `BlockFlow` class has five fields: `host`, `port`, `groups`, `blockflowFetchMaxAge`, and `apiKey`. The `host` and `port` fields specify the hostname and port number of the BlockFlow service. The `groups` field specifies the number of groups to use for sharding. The `blockflowFetchMaxAge` field is a `org.alephium.util.Duration` object that specifies the maximum age of a cached block. Finally, the `apiKey` field is an optional `org.alephium.api.model.ApiKey` object that specifies the API key to use for authentication.\n\nThe `WalletConfig` class provides a `walletConfigReader` implicit value that can be used to read a configuration file and create a `WalletConfig` object. The `BlockFlow` class provides a `uri` field that returns a `sttp.model.Uri` object representing the URI of the BlockFlow service.\n\nOverall, this code provides a convenient way to configure the Alephium wallet and its interaction with the BlockFlow service. An example usage of this code might look like:\n\n```\nimport org.alephium.wallet.config.WalletConfig\n\nval config = com.typesafe.config.ConfigFactory.load().as[WalletConfig](\"wallet\")\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `WalletConfig` class?\n   - The `WalletConfig` class is used to store configuration settings for the Alephium wallet, such as the port number, secret directory path, locking timeout, and blockflow settings.\n\n2. What is the `BlockFlow` class and what information does it store?\n   - The `BlockFlow` class is a nested class within `WalletConfig` that stores information related to the blockflow settings, including the host, port, number of groups, blockflow fetch max age, and an optional API key.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `apiValueReader` and `walletConfigReader` objects?\n   - The `apiValueReader` object is used to read and parse API keys from configuration files, while the `walletConfigReader` object is used to read and parse `WalletConfig` objects from configuration files using the `ValueReader` type class from the Ficus library."
