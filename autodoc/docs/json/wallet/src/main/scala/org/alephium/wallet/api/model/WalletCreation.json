  "summary": "This file contains two case classes, `WalletCreation` and `WalletCreationResult`, which are used in the Alephium wallet API. \n\n`WalletCreation` is a case class that represents the parameters needed to create a new wallet. It takes in a `password` and a `walletName`, which are required fields. Additionally, it has three optional fields: `isMiner`, `mnemonicPassphrase`, and `mnemonicSize`. `isMiner` is a boolean value that indicates whether the wallet is a miner wallet or not. `mnemonicPassphrase` is an optional passphrase that can be used to encrypt the mnemonic phrase. `mnemonicSize` is an optional parameter that specifies the size of the mnemonic phrase. \n\n`WalletCreationResult` is a case class that represents the result of creating a new wallet. It contains the `walletName` and the `mnemonic` phrase. The `mnemonic` phrase is an instance of the `Mnemonic` class from the `org.alephium.crypto.wallet` package. \n\nThese case classes are used in the Alephium wallet API to create new wallets. The `WalletCreation` case class is used to collect the necessary parameters for creating a new wallet, while the `WalletCreationResult` case class is used to return the result of creating a new wallet. \n\nHere is an example of how these case classes might be used in the Alephium wallet API:\n\n```scala\nimport org.alephium.wallet.api.model._\n\nval walletCreation = WalletCreation(\n  password = \"myPassword\",\n  walletName = \"myWallet\",\n  isMiner = Some(false),\n  mnemonicPassphrase = Some(\"myPassphrase\"),\n  mnemonicSize = Some(Mnemonic.Size.Twelve)\n)\n\nval walletCreationResult = WalletCreationResult(\n  walletName = \"myWallet\",\n  mnemonic = Mnemonic.generate(Mnemonic.Size.Twelve)\n)\n``` \n\nIn this example, `walletCreation` is an instance of the `WalletCreation` case class that specifies the parameters for creating a new wallet. `walletCreationResult` is an instance of the `WalletCreationResult` case class that represents the result of creating a new wallet. The `Mnemonic.generate` method is used to generate a new mnemonic phrase with a size of twelve words.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `WalletCreation` case class?\n   - The `WalletCreation` case class is used to represent the parameters needed to create a new wallet, including the password, wallet name, and optional parameters such as whether it is a miner wallet and the size of the mnemonic.\n2. What is the `WalletCreationResult` case class used for?\n   - The `WalletCreationResult` case class is used to represent the result of creating a new wallet, including the wallet name and the mnemonic used to generate the wallet.\n3. What is the `Mnemonic` class imported from?\n   - The `Mnemonic` class is imported from the `org.alephium.crypto.wallet` package, which suggests that it is used for generating and managing mnemonics for wallets in the Alephium project."
