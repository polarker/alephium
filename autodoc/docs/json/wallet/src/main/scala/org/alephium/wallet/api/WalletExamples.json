  "summary": "This file contains code for the `WalletExamples` trait, which provides examples of various API requests and responses for the Alephium wallet. The purpose of this code is to demonstrate how to use the wallet API and provide examples of expected inputs and outputs for different API requests. \n\nThe `WalletExamples` trait imports various classes and objects from other parts of the Alephium project, such as `Amount`, `PublicKey`, and `GroupConfig`. It also defines several constants and variables that are used in the examples, such as `password`, `mnemonic`, `walletName`, `fromGroup`, and `toGroup`. \n\nThe trait defines implicit examples for various API requests and responses, such as `WalletCreation`, `WalletRestore`, `Transfer`, and `Addresses`. These examples are defined using the `Example` class from the `sttp.tapir` library, which allows for specifying example values for different fields in the request or response. \n\nFor example, the `walletCreationExamples` implicit value provides examples of `WalletCreation` requests for different scenarios, such as a user creating a wallet with no additional settings, or a miner creating a wallet with a specific mnemonic size and passphrase. These examples are defined using the `moreSettingsExample` and `simpleExample` helper functions, which take a `WalletCreation` object and a string description of the scenario, and return an `Example` object with example values for the different fields in the request. \n\nOverall, this code provides a useful reference for developers who are working with the Alephium wallet API and need to understand how to format requests and interpret responses.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `alephium.wallet.api` package?\n- The `alephium.wallet.api` package contains code related to the API for interacting with wallets in the Alephium project.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `groupConfig` object?\n- The `groupConfig` object is used to set the number of groups in the Alephium protocol.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `Transfer` case class?\n- The `Transfer` case class is used to represent a transfer of funds from one or more source addresses to one or more destination addresses in the Alephium protocol."
