  "summary": "This code defines a trait called `WalletEndpointsLogic` that provides the implementation for various endpoints related to wallet functionality. The trait extends the `WalletEndpoints` trait, which defines the signatures of these endpoints. The `WalletEndpointsLogic` trait is used to implement the business logic for these endpoints.\n\nThe `WalletEndpointsLogic` trait defines several methods that correspond to the endpoints defined in the `WalletEndpoints` trait. These methods include `createWalletLogic`, `restoreWalletLogic`, `lockWalletLogic`, `unlockWalletLogic`, `deleteWalletLogic`, `getBalancesLogic`, `getAddressesLogic`, `getAddressInfoLogic`, `getMinerAddressesLogic`, `revealMnemonicLogic`, `transferLogic`, `sweepActiveAddressLogic`, `sweepAllAddressesLogic`, `signLogic`, `deriveNextAddressLogic`, `deriveNextMinerAddressesLogic`, `changeActiveAddressLogic`, `listWalletsLogic`, and `getWalletLogic`.\n\nEach of these methods takes input parameters that correspond to the input parameters of the corresponding endpoint defined in the `WalletEndpoints` trait. For example, the `createWalletLogic` method takes a `walletCreation` parameter of type `model.WalletCreation`, which corresponds to the `createWallet` endpoint defined in the `WalletEndpoints` trait.\n\nEach of these methods returns a `Future` that contains the result of the corresponding endpoint. The result is wrapped in a `model.ApiResult` object, which contains either the result of the endpoint or an error message if the endpoint fails.\n\nThe `WalletEndpointsLogic` trait also defines several implicit parameters that are used by the methods to perform their functionality. These include an `ExecutionContext`, a `GroupConfig`, and a `WalletService`. The `ExecutionContext` is used to execute the methods asynchronously. The `GroupConfig` is used to configure the wallet groups. The `WalletService` is used to perform the actual wallet operations.\n\nOverall, this code provides the implementation for the wallet-related endpoints defined in the `WalletEndpoints` trait. It defines the business logic for these endpoints and uses a `WalletService` to perform the actual wallet operations. This code is part of a larger project called `alephium`, which is not described in detail here.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines the logic for various wallet-related endpoints in the Alephium project's web API.\n\n2. What dependencies does this code have?\n- This code imports various classes and traits from other packages in the Alephium project, including `scala.concurrent`, `org.alephium.api.model`, `org.alephium.crypto.wallet`, `org.alephium.protocol.config`, `org.alephium.util`, `org.alephium.wallet.api`, and `org.alephium.wallet.service`.\n\n3. What are some of the endpoints that this code defines?\n- This code defines logic for endpoints such as `createWallet`, `restoreWallet`, `lockWallet`, `unlockWallet`, `deleteWallet`, `getBalances`, `getAddresses`, `getAddressInfo`, `getMinerAddresses`, `revealMnemonic`, `transfer`, `sweepActiveAddress`, `sweepAllAddresses`, `sign`, `deriveNextAddress`, `deriveNextMinerAddresses`, `changeActiveAddress`, `listWallets`, and `getWallet`."
