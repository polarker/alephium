  "summary": "The code above defines a case class called `WalletStatus` that is used to represent the status of a wallet in the Alephium project. The `WalletStatus` case class has two fields: `walletName` of type `String` and `locked` of type `Boolean`.\n\nThe `walletName` field is used to store the name of the wallet, while the `locked` field is used to indicate whether the wallet is currently locked or not. If the `locked` field is `true`, it means that the wallet is currently locked and cannot be accessed. If the `locked` field is `false`, it means that the wallet is currently unlocked and can be accessed.\n\nThis case class is used in the Alephium project to represent the status of a wallet when interacting with the wallet API. For example, when a user wants to check the status of their wallet, they can make a request to the wallet API and receive a response containing a `WalletStatus` object that represents the current status of their wallet.\n\nHere is an example of how this case class might be used in the Alephium project:\n\n```scala\nval walletName = \"my_wallet\"\nval isLocked = true\n\nval walletStatus = WalletStatus(walletName, isLocked)\n\nprintln(s\"Wallet ${walletStatus.walletName} is currently ${if (walletStatus.locked) \"locked\" else \"unlocked\"}\")\n```\n\nIn the example above, we create a new `WalletStatus` object with the `walletName` set to \"my_wallet\" and `locked` set to `true`. We then print out a message indicating the current status of the wallet. In this case, the output would be \"Wallet my_wallet is currently locked\".",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `WalletStatus` case class?\n- The `WalletStatus` case class is used to represent the status of a wallet, including its name and whether it is locked or not.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `final` keyword before the `case class` declaration?\n- The `final` keyword indicates that the `WalletStatus` case class cannot be subclassed or extended by other classes.\n\n3. What is the intended use of this code within the `alephium` project?\n- Based on the package name (`org.alephium.wallet.api.model`), it appears that this code is part of the wallet API model for the `alephium` project, which may be used for interacting with wallets in some way."
