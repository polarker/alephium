  "summary": "The `IOUtils` file is a utility module that provides several functions for handling input/output (IO) operations. The module is part of the Alephium project and is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\nThe module provides several functions for handling IO operations, including creating directories, clearing directories, and removing files and directories. These functions are designed to be used in a safe and efficient manner, and they handle errors and exceptions that may occur during IO operations.\n\nThe `createDirUnsafe` function creates a directory at the specified path if it does not already exist. The function checks if the directory exists using the `Files.exists` method, and if it does not exist, it creates the directory using the `Files.createDirectory` method.\n\nThe `clearUnsafe` function clears the contents of a directory at the specified path. The function checks if the directory exists and is a directory using the `Files.exists` and `Files.isDirectory` methods, and if it is a directory, it removes all files and subdirectories using the `removeUnsafe` function.\n\nThe `removeUnsafe` function removes a file or directory at the specified path. The function checks if the file or directory exists using the `Files.exists` method, and if it is a directory, it recursively removes all files and subdirectories using the `Files.list` method and the `removeUnsafe` function.\n\nThe `tryExecute` and `tryExecuteF` functions are utility functions that execute a function and return an `IOResult` object. The `IOResult` object is a type alias for `Either[IOError, T]`, where `IOError` is an enumeration of IO errors that may occur during IO operations, and `T` is the type of the result of the executed function. The `tryExecute` function executes a function and returns the result as a `Right` object if the function executes successfully, or an `IOError` object as a `Left` object if an error occurs. The `tryExecuteF` function executes a function that returns an `IOResult` object and returns the result as is if the function executes successfully, or an `IOError` object as a `Left` object if an error occurs.\n\nThe `error` function is a partial function that maps exceptions and errors to `IOError` objects. The function is used by the `tryExecute` and `tryExecuteF` functions to handle exceptions and errors that may occur during IO operations.\n\nOverall, the `IOUtils` module provides a set of utility functions for handling IO operations in a safe and efficient manner. These functions are designed to handle errors and exceptions that may occur during IO operations and provide a convenient way to perform common IO operations such as creating directories, clearing directories, and removing files and directories.",
