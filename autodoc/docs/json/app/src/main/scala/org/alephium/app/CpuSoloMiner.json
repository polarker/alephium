  "summary": "The code defines a CPU solo miner for the Alephium cryptocurrency. The miner is implemented as an Akka actor system that communicates with the Alephium network to mine new blocks. The purpose of this code is to provide a simple way for users to mine Alephium blocks using their CPU.\n\nThe `CpuSoloMiner` object is the entry point of the program. It loads the Alephium configuration from a file, creates an Akka actor system, and creates a new instance of the `CpuSoloMiner` class. The `CpuSoloMiner` class is responsible for creating the miner actor and starting the mining process.\n\nThe `miner` field of the `CpuSoloMiner` class is an Akka actor that communicates with the Alephium network to mine new blocks. The `ExternalMinerMock` object is used to create the miner actor. The `ExternalMinerMock` object is a mock implementation of the miner actor that can be used for testing purposes. The `ExternalMinerMock.singleNode` method creates a single-node miner actor that communicates with the Alephium network using the local node. The `ExternalMinerMock.props` method creates a multi-node miner actor that communicates with the Alephium network using a list of API addresses.\n\nThe `parseHostAndPort` method is a utility method that parses a string representation of an API address into an `InetSocketAddress` object. The method uses a regular expression to extract the host and port from the string.\n\nTo use the CPU solo miner, users can run the `CpuSoloMiner` object with the path to the Alephium configuration file as the first command-line argument. For example:\n\n```\n$ sbt \"runMain org.alephium.app.CpuSoloMiner /path/to/alephium.conf\"\n```\n\nOverall, this code provides a simple way for users to mine Alephium blocks using their CPU. The miner actor communicates with the Alephium network to mine new blocks, and the `CpuSoloMiner` class provides a convenient way to start the mining process.",
